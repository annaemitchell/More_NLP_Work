Hopefully we find the breakthrough in fusion powerplant, and we can mass produce them. And if we were able to transfer much energy through lazer, we could make powerplant not on earth. 

Just like NASA invented small camera that we have in phones today, I believe SpaceX will find a solutions to remove radiation on mars, what we can use to clean up on earth as well.

New York have 11 million people, where only 8,4 million actually lives in there. 

If we take worlds population 8,7B shared by 8,4M (new york) we get ~930, what means we need 930 new york city size to fit entire world population today. (If I remember correctly, I did that math very long time ago).

Elon Musk‚Äôs brother are running a company that are about mass producing vegetables in a very tiny area. 

And soon, all nations can come together to make world largest AI waste landfill, where we use technology to detect what material things are made off in order to sort things faster.

# Backstory

When I saw Elon Musk tear up on¬†60 Minutesfacing the verbal assault from one of his heroes ‚Äî Apollo astronaut Gene Cernan ‚Äî I knew what I had to do.

It has taken a bit of effort over the past months, but today I gave this to Elon and all of the SpaceX team, and it was very well received.


When I saw 60 Minutes, my first thought was to get Gene Cernan (the last man to walk on the moon) to visit SpaceX as Elon had implored. I have been buying¬†space artifactsfrom Gene over the past year and knew how to reach him. I tried to encourage him to visit SpaceX, but to no avail. So I flew out to talk to him face to face. I waited until SpaceX became the first private company to bring a spacecraft back from orbit, and the first to bring cargo to the space station, and the first to bring science experiments back. I also gathered signatures and congratulatory sentiments from the other Apollo heroes first.

Some, like Charlie Duke and Al Bean, were effusive in their praise of SpaceX and the next generation of space explorers. Charlie Duke was excited about a future mission to Mars. Al Bean spent 20 minutes writing rough drafts and crafting each word of his message with the SpaceX team in mind.

Then I approached Gene Cernan, and held my breath. I figured it would be a bit more difficult to break from the social proof of his esteemed colleagues. And so he listened. As with every Apollo astronaut who signed this photo, I was able to talk about SpaceX and answer his questions. Gene was interested in who financed SpaceX ‚Äî what big money interests got it going. I told him that Elon Musk personally financed the company for all of its first $100 million, when no one else would bet on the venture, and he saw it through thick and thin, including the first three launches of the Falcon 1, all of which failed spectacularly. As I told him these stories of heroic entrepreneurship, I could see his mind turning. He found a reconciliation: ‚ÄúI never read any of this in the news. Why doesn‚Äôt the press report on this?‚Äù

Cernan was the last hold out.¬†Neil Armstrong wrote a strongly worded letter to 60 Minutes saying that he was taken out of context. The program editor agreed: ""Armstrong wrote us to say we had not been complete in our description of his testimony. He's right.

&gt;Armstrong is, arguably, the greatest explorer of the 20th Century. I suspect he has admiration for anyone in science or business who sees new possibilities. He may not be confident in a particular federal policy, but I imagine Neil Armstrong stands squarely on the side of those who dare to dream.""

"It depends. Russian Oligarchs, for example, don't come by their billions honestly. As for Jeff Bezos, it can be argued that he doesn't take a proactive enough role in changing the world for the better. Most billionaires like him just have a ""one-and-done"" business which is the source of their wealth. The way Elon is different is that he has always dumped all of his assets back into his companies: the 21/22 million from the Zip2 sale went into the X.com/Paypal online banking, then all of the money from that went into SpaceX and Tesla. He doesn't actually have any wealth that is not stock in his companies. He literally takes out loans that use his stock as collateral to buy wealthy-person things. 

Taxing someone Elon, and taxing some billionaire who has made their money by corrupt oil or tax-payer money from lobbying or the money from oppressed citizens (looking at you CCP), are two different things.",elonmusk

&gt;The pending launch ignited Musk‚Äôs salesman instincts. He wanted to show the public what his tireless workers had accomplished and drum up some excitement around SpaceX.

The company would haul the seven-story-high Falcon 1 across the country on a specially built rig and leave it‚Äîand the SpaceX mobile launch system‚Äîoutside of the Federal Aviation Administration‚Äôs headquarters in Washington, D.C. An accompanying press conference would make it clear to Washington that a modern, smarter, cheaper rocket maker had arrived.

"Thanks for pointing to it. There's a lot more details in this one.

&gt;Washington snubbed Musk just as it had Beal. The establishment‚Äîthe large contractors, members of Congress, even many in NASA‚Äîsaw him as just another multimillionaire with a toy space company. A dilettante who couldn‚Äôt possibly succeed. Few took Musk seriously.

&gt;‚ÄúAt the beginning, we had to beg NASA to even pay attention,‚Äù recalled Lawrence Williams, SpaceX‚Äôs vice president of strategic relations at the time.

&gt;By the end of 2003, Musk decided that if NASA wouldn‚Äôt come to him, he would go to it. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was preparing to celebrate the hundredth anniversary of the Wright Brothers‚Äô first powered flight with a party at the National Air and Space Museum, and Musk decided he‚Äôd show up‚Äîand bring his new rocket.

&gt;For the event, SpaceX loaded the seven-story rocket onto the back of a custom trailer and hauled it cross-country to Washington, DC. With a police escort, it paraded down Independence Avenue, along the National Mall, hallowed ground that had been witness to myriad spectacles, marches, protests. But it had never seen anything quite like this.

&gt;As Musk, then thirty-two years old, parked his rocket outside the headquarters of the FAA, tourists who were headed to the National Air and Space Museum stopped to gawk at the streetside exhibit, even in the freezing temperatures. A shiny, white missile that stretched seven stories long, squatting in the real estate usually reserved for hot dog vendors. A cabbie stopped, agog, as the trailer took up an entire lane of traffic‚Äîat rush hour. The spectacle was pure Silicon Valley swagger, like an Apple product unveiling, but before Steve Jobs had perfected the art of hyping a new gadget to the masses.

&gt;...\*details about the press event*...

&gt;And so this spectacle on the National Mall was more than just a debut for his new rocket. It was a warning shot to such companies as Lockheed Martin and Boeing. Beal had not been able to break their vise grip on the industry. But Musk was armed with a new rocket, and a newly minted fortune that he was ready to burn.

&gt;He was coming for them.",elonmusk

"When weather permitted it was more like 80-90+.

Paid off a house, brought my credit up from 300s to almost 800, and paid off 6 figure medical debt (yay murica.)

I was laid up almost a year before i got that job while my wife worked 2 jobs as we continued to fall behind.

I somehow along the way discovered personal financing and investing books.  Then business and real estate investing books along with it.

That shit sucked and I'm far from rich but I'm comfortably making my way to early retirement.  My only bad debt will be a $650mo mortgage pretty soon.  If things keep going the way i hope i won't even have bills besides cellphones and internet in 5 years.

After that I'll basically be free to just gamble with investments or blindly throw money darts at the board and keep whatever sticks.

I was raised to work hard.  Harder than anyone around me.  It wasn't bad advice.  Just old advice.  I'm proud of the work I've done and it's made it boatloads easier to turn that work ethic from swinging hammers and wrenches into book/real life experiences investing.

It's okay to work hard.  As long as you have a good reason for it and don't get burned out.  If you have the stomach for it there are tons of easier ways to make a living then punching a time clock and buying shiny shit with credit just to make you happy enough to continue the cycle.",elonmusk

Around here you either wait for people to retire for a good job, luck into one, or start a small business.

Normally you hear about someone needing an employee and then make a phone call or stop by their house to ask for the job.

I can tell you that I've had a lot of jobs earlier in life.  Lived a few short spans in cities even.

But i learned more in a few months of reading personal finance and investing books than i ever would have in school.

If you work on how to invest so you don't have to have a job half as hard as you do getting into debt for a meme degree just so you can work until you die you'll be a lot happier.  I know I am.",elonmusk

I blame those asshats in the 70s taking us off the gold standard.  Our money is now worth less than half of what it was due to inflation.  Couple that with technological advances and an overly complicated tax code and we are begging for disaster.

Back in the day a guy could be a general laborer 40 hours a week with a stay at home wife, home, insurance, new truck, decent used or new car, and get along just fine.

Now both parents have to work and pawn their kids off on the school or the sitter's.

Then a generation of kids being bribed to act good and given whatever they want to just to shut them up become parents and society just degrades.

* **Cartoonish Nature of Story** : Just read the interview and see if you want to believe his cartoonish tales of him being some globe trotting Pablo Escobar like character , mines sending uncut gems directly to their shareholders instead of money , and stories of nationwide jewellery retailer ( Tiffany &amp; Co.¬†on Fifth Avenue in New York ) buying uncut stones from random 16 year olds off the street ( hint : they don't , maybe your local pawn shop might but these companies have supply chains ). **Seriously , read it yourself.**

* **Reason for lying** : In each of the two interviews , the point of the story was to come to the conclusion , as shown in the below excerpts from the same ,

 &gt;It was that lifestyle, Errol says, that turned Elon into the kind of merchant adventurer who would later¬†break the rules of the motoring business¬†with Tesla, then go on to¬†change spaceflight with SpaceX. ( *From first interview* )

"&gt;Has he actually made any considerable progress on the brain implants that wasn't already there?

Good writeup on the integration involved.

&gt;For a device that small, the team packed an admirable array of features into it. The ‚ÄúLink‚Äù device has over 1,000 channels, which can be individually activated. This is on par with¬†Neuropixel, the cr√®me de la cr√®me of neural probes with 960 recording channels that‚Äôs currently used widely in research, including by the Allen Institute for Brain Science.

&gt;Compared to the Utah Array, a legendary implant system used for brain stimulation in humans with only 256 electrodes, the Link has an obvious edge up in terms of pure electrode density.

&gt;What‚Äôs perhaps most impressive, however, is its onboard processing for neural spikes‚Äîthe electrical pattern generated by neurons when they fire. Electrical signals are fairly chaotic in the brain, and filtering spikes from noise, as well as separating trains of electrical activity into spikes, normally requires quite a bit of processing power. This is why in the lab, neural spikes are usually recorded offline and processed using computers, rather than with on-board electronics.

&gt;The problem gets even more complicated when considering wireless data transfer from the implanted device to an external smartphone. Without accurate and efficient compression of those neural data, the transfer could tremendously lag, drain battery life, or heat up the device itself‚Äîsomething you don‚Äôt want happening to a device stuck inside your skull.

&gt;To get around these problems, the team has been working on algorithms that use ‚Äúcharacteristic shapes‚Äù of electrical patterns that look like spikes to efficiently identify individual neural firings. The data is processed on the chip inside the skull device. Recordings from each channel are filtered to root out obvious noise, and the spikes are then detected in real time. Because different types of neurons have their characteristic ways of spiking‚Äîthat is, the ‚Äúshape‚Äù of their spikes are diverse‚Äîthe chip can also be configured to detect the particular spikes you‚Äôre looking for. This means that in theory the chip could be programmed to only capture the type of neuron activity you‚Äôre interested in‚Äîfor example, to look at inhibitory neurons in the cortex and how they control neural information processing.

&gt;These processed spike data are then sent out to smartphones or other external devices through Bluetooth to enable wireless monitoring. Being able to do this efficiently has been a stumbling block in wireless brain implants‚Äîraw neural recordings are too massive for efficient transfer, and automated spike detection and compression of that data is difficult, but a necessary step to allow neural interfaces to finally ‚Äúcut the wire.‚Äù

&gt;Link has other impressive features. For one, the battery life lasts all day, and the device can be charged at night using inductive charging. From my subsequent conversations with the team, it seems like there will be alignment lights to help track when the charger is aligned with the device. What‚Äôs more, the Link itself also has an internal temperature sensor to monitor for over-heating, and will automatically disconnect if the temperature rises above a certain threshold‚Äîa very necessary safety measure so it doesn‚Äôt overheat the surrounding skull tissue.

ohh he wasn't diving. well fuck him then and all the help he gave.,elonmusk
"**On Paypal**

Elon founded a company called X.com which later merged with another called coinfinity, which was co-founded by Peter Thiel. X constituted half the post-merger equity and more than half the employees of the merged company which later became PayPal. He lead the company in it's formative years and even pivoted to the current business model.

&gt;The original business plan focused on allowing people to transfer money electronically via the Palm hand-held computer. But Musk quickly saw that the ‚Äúkiller‚Äù application would be a system that allowed the secure e-mailing of payments using any type of PC, according to Sacks, the former PayPal COO.

From [David Saks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_O._Sacks) ,  founding COO and product leader of¬†PayPal till sale to ebay, in [Article](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2003-apr-22-fi-spacex22-story.html)

By the time he was replaced with Thiel , the business model was already figured out , the company had already scaled and was one of the largest payment providers. Neither the business model nor the end product saw major changes over that period.

&gt;not his orginal idea

Yes , confinity had a product called PayPal , but the idea isn't the main thing. There were also many well funded competitors already, such as Citigroup with their c2it email payment service, BancOne's emoneymail, Yahoo's PayDirect, Western Union's BidPay, etc. Even X had a email payment service. What mattered was turning it into the market leader and a money making one at that, which included

* Solving PayPal's problem of losing money because people would instantly take out the money to their bank account after transfers. The key to making it a success was incentivising people to keep their money there by offering bank like services. Paypal started offering things like money market fund and debit card , borrowed over from X which managed to do just that.

* Lowering their charges. The main thing that set PayPal apart ( minimising credit card transfer and their charges by enabling bank to bank transfer where they authenticated accounts by sending a small unique amount that the user had to then enter ) was also developed under his tenure.",elonmusk
"&gt;**tesla - Not a orginal fouder**

Elon wanted to commercialize [a prototype called the T-Zero by AC Propulsion.](https://i.imgur.com/nPj6twT.png) As he didn't have the time to run both spacex and the new company , the AC zero guys sent him to another team looking to commercialize it.

&gt;AC Propulsion developed the idea, and both Eberhard and Musk initially approached the San Dimas, California, company to build the car. 

&gt;Both Eberhard and Musk saw the importance ‚Äì and potential ‚Äì of what Gage and Cocconi had created. When Eberhard and Musk approached them individually to prod them into taking the next step and produce the vehicle, Gage opted instead to introduce Musk to Eberhard and get back to work creating¬†the eBox, an electrified Scion xB that Gage considered more practical and economical.

[Source](https://www.wired.com/2009/06/tesla-founder/)

When Musk approached Martin , the business consisted of nothing but an unfunded business plan to commercialize the T-Zero. While there was a basic corporation in place, Tesla hadn‚Äôt even registered or obtained the trademark to its name and had no formal offices or assets.

To save legal fees, they even copied the SpaceX articles of incorporation and bylaws for Tesla. Even the Tesla logo was designed by RO Studio, same guys Musk had hired to design the SpaceX logo.

Again from previous wired article article

&gt;And Musk didn't act sooner to replace Eberhard, either in the early days when one member of the management team sought his ouster or at the series C round of funding when a top-tier venture capitalist conditioned an investment offer on Eberhard's departure (In both cases, Musk backed Eberhard). Both men have privately, and sometimes publicly, regretted those decisions.

Elon supported Martin even though others protested that he wasn't running the company properly. When it came to light he was lying about the costs of the roadster , Musk ousted reluctantly replaced him, running both companies and pouring every bit of money he had into it, saving it.

Later Martin sued to make the first two sole founders , while Elon wanted all of the early team ( including JB , who joined after him , and he himself bought on ) as co-founders.

[Judge strikes down request that former CEO Martin Eberhard be declared one of only two founders of the automotive start-up.](https://www.cnet.com/news/teslas-musk-gloats-over-eberhard-ruling/)

&gt; A San Mateo County Superior Court judge on Wednesday denied former Tesla Motors CEO Martin Eberhard's request that he be declared one of only two Tesla founders, according to a statement released by Tesla Motors late Wednesday night.

&gt; The ruling is in keeping with¬†Tesla's claim that the company was founded by a team of several people, including Musk, rather than just two men.",elonmusk

"**On SpaceX**

**&gt;copied other peoples work**

Remind me of the other company/organization that did reuse of a orbital class rocket with supersonic retropropulsion till now. I'll wait. Or a full flow staged combustion engine or a working methane engine.

**&gt;just dumps money in to the research**

&gt;He does do technical work. He is intimately involved in the design process, though I doubt that includes making 3D CAD designs of individual parts, programming flight software, or anything like that.

\- Reliability Analysis Engineer at SpaceX

&gt;Elon is both the Chief Executive Officer and¬†Chief¬†Technology¬†Officer¬†of SpaceX, so of course he does more than just ‚Äòsome¬†very technical work‚Äô. He is integrally involved in the actual design and engineering of the rocket, and at least touches every other aspect of the business (but I would say the former takes up much more of his mental real estate). Elon is an engineer at heart, and that‚Äôs where and how he works best.

\- Former Head of Quality Assurance at SpaceX

Sourced from [here](https://www.quora.com/Does-Elon-Musk-do-some-very-technical-work-code-design-etc-at-SpaceX) . I have gone though LinkedIn and other details online and don't think these people are lying about their positions. Other anecdotes can be found on places like hackernews but without profiles can't be verified.

Also excerpts from [Tom Mueller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Mueller) , Former CTO of Propulsion at SpaceX and main guy behind the Merlin engines, speaking [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/6b043z/_/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacexlounge/comments/hcn6pc/_/) to a very small group of students , where the stream was later removed , but the community saved the transcript.

&gt;We‚Äôll have, you know, a group of people sitting in a room, making a key decision. And everybody in that room will say, you know, basically, ‚ÄúWe need to turn left,‚Äù and Elon will say ‚ÄúNo, we‚Äôre gonna turn right.‚Äù You know, to put it in a metaphor. And that‚Äôs how he thinks. He‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúYou guys are taking the easy way out; we need to take the hard way.‚Äù 

&gt;And, uh, I‚Äôve seen that hurt us before, I‚Äôve seen that fail, but I‚Äôve also seen‚Äî where nobody thought it would work‚Äî it was the right decision. It was the harder way to do it, but in the end, it was the right thing.

&gt;...

&gt;And now we have the lowest-cost, most reliable engines in the world. And it was basically because of that decision, to go to do that. So that‚Äôs one of the examples of Elon just really pushing‚Äî he always says we need to push to the limits of physics.

&gt; ""Elon was the right guy and the best mentor.""

&gt;Elon is brilliant. He‚Äôs involved in just about everything. He understands everything. If he asks you a question, you learn very quickly not to go give him a gut reaction.

&gt;He wants answers that get down to the fundamental laws of physics. One thing he understands really well is the physics of the rockets. He understands that like nobody else. The stuff I have seen him do in his head is crazy.

&gt;He can get in discussions about flying a satellite and whether we can make the right orbit and deliver Dragon at the same time and solve all these equations in real time. It‚Äôs amazing to watch the amount of knowledge he has accumulated over the years.

"&gt;Saving fuel has nothing do with cost

With traditional launchers the fuel for the upper stages or the exploration stage takes a considerable about of the stupidly expensive payload. If you can reduce the fuel mass, you can increase the actually useful payload, without making the mission even more expensive. Traditional mission profiles to Mars call for several fuel launches on expendable launchers. Obviously you want to minimise the number of fuel launches. If you can cut back even one launch with a flyby at venus, you can easily save 200 millions on your mission, making it more likely to be approved by Congress. 

With Starship nothing of that is a concern.


&gt;What is a flyby at the sun?

Bad wording by me. I meant a flyby at venus. Such a trajectory brings you closer to the sun and thus increases the radiation density.",elonmusk

"It would not based on these assumptions:

Starship empty weight: 117,934kg

Starship volume: 1000 cubic meters

Venus atmosphere density (surface): 65 kg/cubic meter

The density of the an empty starship is 117 kg/cubic meter. So even at the surface it would not be buoyant. Even if we pulled a vacuum inside starship. 

To achieve a liveable temperature of 30-40c it's seems we would need a floating base around 40km high with an atmospheric pressure showing around 2 bar'ish. This zone is a sulphuric acid haze zone. It seems completely plausible to create a craft that would be rigid and buoyant at that altitude.

Don't have to spend months traveling to Mars or Venus, the Moon is just hours away.

Yes, AFIS has existed and been used since the 90s. However, that doesn't take less than an hour.

However, even when AFIS turns up a match, that match still needs to be examined by someone for it to be treated as admissible evidence.

There‚Äôs an old Chinese proverb that says:‚ÄùGive a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime‚Äù That‚Äôs the biggest difference between Bill Gates and Elon Musk, Bill Gates is buying you fish &amp; chips for a day, Elon Musk teaches you how to fish. Al-tough a more accurate metaphor when it comes to both men‚Äôs philanthropic endeavors would be that Bill Gates is trying to cure cancer by only treating the symptoms whereas Elon Musk ignores the symptoms but try to find the source of the tumors in order to cut it out.

At first glance Bill Gates seems to be a much more generous and influential philanthropist than Elon Musk, Gates Foundation commits $258.3 million to cure malaria in developing countries and provides free Malaria vaccine in India.

Elon Musk on the other hand, makes electric cars and created his own foundation that funds clean energy research and science advocacy (see the amazing ‚Äôs answer for more details on this), which appears to be much less impressive than Bill Gates‚Äôs ‚Äúgood deeds‚Äù, in fact, I can‚Äôt even count how many times I have seen the question:‚ÄùWhy don‚Äôt Elon Musk just donate his money to solve world hunger instead of squandering it to explore Mars?‚Äù posted and retweeted by scientifically illiterate people all over the world, and they couldn‚Äôt be more wrong.

For example, China's polluted air kills 4,400 a day, India‚Äôs Malaria infected mosquitoes kill 2,7 a day, so Elon Musk‚Äôs endeavors(open source electric car patents and clean energy research) has the potential to save 4,400 lives per day in China and will lead to the creation of a lot of jobs, on the other hand, Bill Gates‚Äôs endeavors although commendable will ‚Äúonly‚Äù save 2,7 lives per day in India. So even though Elon Musk is donating less money to charities than Bill Gates, Elon is actually being more philanthropic than Bill Gates.

[About the Aero L-39 Albatros](http://twinandturbine.com/article/l-39-albatros-fly-fighter-jet/)

After Elon Musk made his¬†first millions¬†from the sales of Zip2 and PayPal, he invested much of the money into founding SpaceX in 2002 and co-founding Tesla in 2003. But in addition to launching two of the world's most famous startups, Musk also devoted some cash to his love of aviation.


Musk describes flying it [here](https://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2003/10/06/350397/index.htm)

&gt;Probably the most fun plane I have is a Russian fighter jet. It's called an L-39. It has a Czech air frame, a Ukrainian engine, Russian avionics. It's what they used to train their fighter pilots on, so it's incredibly acrobatic. But your butt hurts if you fly in it for more than an hour. The seats are really hard.

&gt;You can do eight Gs in that plane. You pretty much need a G-suit, or you could black out. I might go up to five, but that's the most. Five Gs means that's five times your body weight. It's pretty hard to move. You feel very heavy. Your cheeks are being sucked down. If you maintain five Gs for too long, it's very hard to concentrate. You start seeing red dots.

&gt;Probably the most fun flight I did was with another L-39 in Nevada. It's kind of open airspace, so we did a tail chase, where we basically followed another plane through the mountains at very low altitude. Literally, it was just like in Top Gun. You're no more than a couple of hundred feet above the ground, following the contour of the mountains. We came up to a mountain, did a vertical climb up the side of it, inverted. Turned upside down. Yeah, that was fun. It's like a roller coaster. Only you go much farther up and down.

Him on stopping , from [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2008/09/24/DI2008092402502.html)

&gt;Sadly, I don't pilot myself any more, but do have a (lapsed) multi-engine IFR rating. I have to work when I fly and have too many thoughts in my head to pay the necessary attention to the plane -- I can be absentminded at times, which is a really bad habit for a pilot.",elonmusk

 - Adjusting your work space to be comfortable, this include reducing glare, making sure your screen is only as bright as ambient lighting (hold up a sheet of paper next to the screen and adjust brightness to match)
 - Adjust your display to be moderate contrast, not extreme black-and-white
 - Use larger font sizes so you're not straining to focus on tiny letters

"Gonna go on a rant here, But I love how much tesla has impacted the automotive industry and the space industry (but I'll talk about that another time)

When tesla stated they were nobody's with a small crappy factory, but when you look at them now they've shaped and changes the electric automotive industry the gigafactory is the largest building in length. 

People kept saying ""you can't make cheap and reliable electric cars with long range they won't work"" 

But just like landing and reusing a rocket, Elon and his team proved them wrong. 

Look at how many automotive companies are now pushing for electric cars, nearly every car company has come out and said that they're making a new electric or electric hybrid car. 

There may have been a few bumps along the way (I'm looking at you roadster and model S production) 

But look at them now. Tesla stock is insane and they're cars are rated some of the most reliable and safest cars in the market for a budget. 

Elon not only helped the company but saved and changed it, but he's not the only one there we can't forget about fanz (the lead designer at tesla)

Tesla are fantastic and their consistent improvements on full self driving and autopilot are basically unheard from other automotive companies (that I'm aware of) not to mention the updates to the software and adding new games and features like Spotify and Netflix. 

Also the app, we can't forget about the app YOU CAN CALL AND SUMMON YOUR CAR TO YOU FROM A MOTHER FUCKING APP, YOU CAN EVEN OPEN YOUR CAR FROM THE APP! No need for a key when YOU ARE THE KEY. I haven't even seen another car company do stuff like that.

"I find it all very interesting.  Airing on the side of caution, I agree with you.  Tesla hasn't the revenue to validate such a stock price, but their price has been largely influenced by speculation and remarks by Elon Musk, and he has always delivered on what he promises. Maybe not on time, but delivered what he's promised.  

As for foreign markets like China, if you can afford a vehicle you don't need a EV with a 500km range, you need 50km to maybe 100km.  Keep in mind about one third of Chinese live below the upper middle income of making $5.50/day or 30 yuan/day. 

https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/china/overview

 Their cheaper EVs are more likely to suit their budget.  If you ever get a chance to go to Beijing, their transit system is extensive and state of the art.  We went to Beijing, Hong Kong, and Taiwan and easily got around the city without a car a majority of the time.  I think it cost us $.50 to ride the train anywhere throughout Beijing.  With a population of around 9 million, it lead us to believe most people don't own their own vehicles.  But thats just speculation on my part.

Europe was well into renewable energy and EVs before Tesla came along so I agree with you there.  I dont think Tesla with ever be the front runner in Europe or China given their situations.  Tesla will need to come out with vehicle with a purchase price below $30k to ever have a shot at competing better in both China and Europe.  

I decided to invest in Tesla after watching them for about two years.  It was volatile price changes, but pretty much sideways trading despite their revenue increasing ten fold. They were due for a comeuppance.  Gigafactory 3 and the announcement of a Cybertruck did me in.  As long as production is ramping up now with GF4 and GF5 in building stages their overall revenue will continue to increase.  Unless someone comes out with a better product, I'm holding.",elonmusk

Noradrenaline is released to motivate action, and dopamine is released when your brain feels like you are ""making progress"" or ""on the right track"". If there is not enough dopamine to counteract the noradreinaline, there is a ""noradrenaline quit system"" which makes you give up at what you are doing (whether that is running a marathon, studying schoolwork or working on some task). If you can create a situation where you feel you are on the right track, for example by successfully achieving small goals along the way or linking the task with some important overall purpose, then you might last longer.",elonmusk

Stupid law and stupid judge. It's about [this tweet](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/998454539941367808?s=19)

&gt;Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues &amp; give up stock options for nothing? Our safety record is 2X better than when plant was UAW &amp; everybody already gets healthcare.

which is clearly talking about the fact that other companies with the UAW do not have stock options for their employees , which he even clarifies [here](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/999415738967277568?s=19)

&gt;Exactly. UAW does not have individual stock ownership as part of the compensation at any other company.

And to put some source behind what he said in the tweet

Same plant under GM/Toyota under the same UAW , before Tesla took over 

&gt;Under Toyota and GM leadership, the factory had an average recordable incident rate of 12.6 between 2003 and 2009, and in each of these years, the numbers were worse than the industry average. However, Tesla recorded a rate of just 6.2 last year.¬†

[Source](https://www.motortrend.com/news/teslas-fremont-factory-now-achieves-industry-average-safety/?&amp;ampcf=1)

&gt;**Fired an employee one day before his stock options vested**

Weird he made so much noise about this lawsuit and that back in 2017 , but no peep since then. Maybe there was a legitimate reason to be fired.

&gt;**Fired staff after promising them they could take unpaid time off if they didn‚Äôt feel comfortable returning to work during COVID**

When they were open early in defiance of the County , not indefinitely and that too without notice. 

You want Tesla to keep them forever on the rolls, while they collect unemployment benefits sitting at home, while all their other colleagues are working?

&gt;""Speculation over the name X √Ü A-12 has been a major topic of conversation since the couple welcomed the baby boy into the world on Monday, with questions over what the characters mean.

&gt;The Canadian musician -- real name Claire Elise Boucher -- previously explained that √Ü is the Elven spelling of AI, which is shorthand for artificial intelligence.

&gt;""It's just X, like the letter X. Then A.I. Like how you said the letter A then I,""¬†wrote¬†Grimes on Thursday in response to a query on Instagram.""

Later in that article:

&gt;""She explained ""X"" stood for ""the unknown variable,"" while √Ü -- AI -- was shorthand for artificial intelligence and translates to ""love"" in several languages.""

So it means artificial intelligence in elven, but also love in multiple languages (including Japanese and Chinese, as we revealed in this thread).",elonmusk

Before battery day there was the split day. Prior to the split, people were hiking up the price. After the split, it is profit taking.

Here is the news that you should consider: 

1. Tesla is no longer the number 1 selling EV car in many European and the Chinese market. 

2.  VW is now in the game. To compete with the 3 and the Y.

3. Taycan is cannibalizing workers from other areas of Audi because they can't keep up with the demand.

4. Nikola shares jumped because of GM getting in. 

5. Tesla service issues and end of quarter shoddiness have become permanent features. 

6. Battery day reveal will HAVE to be siginificantly  overpowering in its value to negate the bad news and competition.  Competition that used to be not thought of but is now a reality. 

I own a model 3. I owned shares, made a very handsome gain on the ride up leading into the split. Sold. Will wait for the share value to drop to around 50 to 70 range. Knowing futute gains will NEVER be the same as made in the last three years.",elonmusk

I watched the video and I think there is validity to applying this argument across the political spectrum. There is no Marxist apocolypse or Conservative plague. There are opinions and positions. The best anyone can do is reference as many sources as possible and take in the information yourself. To truly do this, you must be vulnerable, because sometimes the truth really hurts... and it's often difficult to accept that your opinion can change, that something you have held for so long may be false.

And you're also implying that it's acceptable (in your opinion) for him to 'cut corners' short term in order to fulfil his benevolent long term goals sooner? This is where I would disagree.
I would say his actions were dangerous and not necessary, considering all that would have happened was Tesla production being delayed by a few months to a year. Hardly worth the risk of loss of life to get humans to mars sooner.

Same as everyone else. They all are talking about doing that because cobalt  = dirty hands. 
While they get a ""free ticket"" to keep using cobalt because *""they're going with cobalt free, someday""*.

Anyway, don't miss even if Tesla reduces the cobalt use they're getting worse the problem because they're using way more cobalt. A Tesla battery is around x10,000 bigger than a little Smartphone battery.

"""no one can generate that much value on your own.""

He didn't. He started with selling his computer game for a few hundred dollars, and then proceeded the same way most people did (get in school, learn more stuff), then he makes x.com (not xcom the game), merges with his brother's company... they make paypal, and a majority of the people there (paypal mafia) go on and do things on their own, they all become big etc etc.

"Yeah, *some* of it does, some as in a single donation of around 250 million, as far as I could find from a google search, which is around 0.2% of his total net worth. Giving to charity is a good thing, but it does not mean he is not still hoarding massive amounts of wealth.  


 20 million people die of easily preventable deaths annually because they do not have the resources to save themselves. To put it into perspective, given the holocaust took four years, that's about 7.2 holocausts every year. Elon Musk could use his wealth to save literally millions of lives without even affecting his own lifestyle. He is so wealthy, he could give away dozens of billions of dollars,  perhaps just stop one of those seven holocausts happening annually, and his life wouldn't change at all.   


And he doesn't. If you have the ability to stop the holocaust with no harm or real sacrifice on yourself, since it's not a sacrifice to give away something you weren't even using, and you choose not to, you are an evil person.",elonmusk

"It's a necessity in this system. I'm talking money profit.

Imagine that in some remote place on Earth, a large population suddenly loses all their food production and without outside help, would starve. If the costs of taking the food there are greater than what the locals could spend buying it, nobody would give them the help they need. That's awful, and shouldn't happen in any good system.

Now guess what, it happens in every country. Lots of people starve because there isn't enough profit to be made selling them food. Even though enough food is produced, and a lot of it ends up in the trash.",elonmusk
"I think you're grasping at straws at this point. 

While it's true he's one of the richest people in the world now, one cannot just give out billions and still maintain a controlling stock in his companies. You'd think it would be ""evil"" not to maintain a certain % to keep control of his companies but if you think about how he was booted from paypal, then you'd know surviving in a corporate world is vastly different from surviving in say.... school or something.


To say that he can save millions of lives without affecting his own lifestyle (implying that he hasn't) is also offputting in a way. It's very possible to donate secretly btw, and he has done that.

"&gt;No no, the ‚Äúideal‚Äù life according to these numbskulls is to still be poor as f* and spread the wealth around. You know what‚Äôs eerily similar to that? communism.

You are also mistaking communism as a concept of wealth redistribution (Socialism, like healthcare and education etc) and ""communism"" 

Communism can be the failed attempts where it never actually happened and was more of a fascist dictatorship, or the never realized concept like you mentioned. Just saying ""Communism bad"" is pretty silly because it has never happened. Either way that is not what I am trying to talk about.

What has actually happened is these ""numbskulls"" you are talking about wanting wealth redistribution (better word is socialism). Also known as taxes, benefiting society. So when a mega billionaire like Bezos makes a shit ton of money and pays barely any taxes for his corporation and treats employees like shit, people want some wealth redistribution. 

He has taken advantage of the system to the point where many others suffer and doesn't benefit the system by paying back into it. I don't know Musk's effects in these ways, and I admire what he has done, but wanting wealth redistribution is still fine.",elonmusk

"BokuWaKamida explained it well. Only thing i will add is this: the theoretical Instagram posts that say if Bezos and Musk and Gates all put their money together it would solve world hunger is completely false. The western world is built upon its own giants of commerce. When people‚Äôs wealth is stored in shares, that means they must sell them to access the cash. If Bezos sold more than 5% of Amazon at once or in the same quarter, the Amazon price would be effected. ‚ÄúWhy is Bezos selling off? Should i also?..‚Äù it‚Äôs possible Bezos selling his shares and taking, example, 1 billion dollars out, the share price impact from doing that could result in him losing 5% of every share, which would be a fuckton more than 1 billion worth of $. Net worth from shares held is misleading because it‚Äôs trapped. In Elon‚Äôs case, he LITERALLY cannot sell for at least 5 years in his Chairman contract, allowing the price to maintain stability.",elonmusk

"(Ignore grammar mistakes, I'm german as you can imagine) 

T√ºbingen is a city in Baden W√ºrttemberg (Germany) and my hometown. It's not a huge but also not a small city. T√ºbingen is famous for it's university, many students and science. 

The vaccine manufacturer CureVac has its headquarters here. Tesla cooperates with CureVac and Elon visited them to see a new 3D printing technology, which could speed up the production of a Corona vaccination. 

MONDAY:
When I read that Elon would visit T√ºbingen, I was over the moon. Elon is my idol and an inspiration for me, I'm following his work for years now. That Elon Musk would come into my city was just surreal. 
Sadly I was on vacation, I knew I wouldn't have the chance to see him. I thought: ""If I can't see him, my friends should."" so I told all my friends in T√ºbingen that Elon would come. They are also fans and were really excited too. 

In the beginning it wasn't even clear, if Elon would come directly to T√ºbingen but then CureVacs press officer confirmed it. 
Elon would arrive on Tuesday at a unknown time at the CureVac HQ but he didn't want press. It would be ""undercover‚Äú.
Knowing he would definitely come, we read news articles and searched through social media. We wanted to calculate the rough time when we could see him, arriving at CureVac. We had a battle plan! ‚Üì
1. Wait in front of the CureVac building for Elon to arrive
2. Take a look at him when he goes into it.
3. Maybe ask him for photo. (A photo with Elon Musk is our biggest dream.) 

TUESDAY MORNING:
At 7 AM, 3 of my friends went to the CureVac building. Then they prepared them self to wait. 
With time more fans joined them. Some Teslas, driven by enthusiastic fans, parked on the parking lot. 
After a few hours CureVac had to order security to the building, because they were so many fans waiting. 
You have to know that the whole thing was a big event for us locals. Reporters were also waiting and there even was a live feed with the latest news. 

TUESDAY 4 PM: 
After 8 hours of waiting in heavy rainfall a Model X showed up at the end of the street. 
In it, on the passenger seat, was Elon. 
The car drove immediately in the underground car park, Elon didn't even greeted the fans. The local reporters shot some pictures.
Some fans (among them my friends) were dispirited and sad because they only saw Elon for a few seconds through the car window, they left. Others didn't give up and luckily stayed.


TUESDAY 8 PM:
After hours of meetings Elon came out of the building. He was surrounded by CureVac employees and bodyguards and had a black bandana wrapped around his face.  
He walked across the field in front of the CureVac building to bath in the crowd of the (around 50) fans, who waited. 
As far as I know everybody kept distance and he only exchanged a couple of words with a few people. Many fans made selfies from a distance. 
There was a engineering student, who had a sign with the words ""I WANT TO WORK FOR YOU!"". He showed Elon a self-built fully electric motorcycle. Elon was very interested and they talked a for a while.

"(Ignore grammar mistakes, I'm german as you can imagine) 

T√ºbingen is a city in Baden W√ºrttemberg (Germany) and my hometown. It's not a huge but also not a small city. T√ºbingen is famous for it's university, many students and science. 

The vaccine manufacturer CureVac has its headquarters here. Tesla cooperates with CureVac and Elon visited them to see a new 3D printing technology, which could speed up the production of a Corona vaccination. 

MONDAY:

When I read that Elon would visit T√ºbingen, I was over the moon. Elon is my idol and an inspiration for me, I'm following his work for years now. That Elon Musk would come into my city was just surreal. 
Sadly I was on vacation, I knew I wouldn't have the chance to see him. I thought: ""If I can't see him, at least my friends should."" so I told all my friends in T√ºbingen that Elon would come. They are also fans and were really excited too. 

In the beginning it wasn't even clear, if Elon would come directly to T√ºbingen but then CureVacs press officer confirmed it. 
Elon would arrive on Tuesday at a unknown time at the CureVac HQ but he didn't want press. It would be ""undercover‚Äú.
Knowing he would definitely come, we read news articles and searched through social media. We wanted to calculate the rough time when we could see him, arriving at CureVac. We had a battle plan! ‚Üì
1. Wait in front of the CureVac building for Elon to arrive
2. Take a look at him when he goes into it.
3. Maybe ask him for photo. (A photo with Elon Musk is our biggest dream.) 

TUESDAY:

At 7 AM, 3 of my friends went to the CureVac building. Then they prepared them self to wait. 
With time more fans joined them. Some Teslas, driven by enthusiastic fans, parked on the parking lot. 
After a few hours CureVac had to order security to the building, because they were so many fans waiting. 
You have to know that the whole thing was a big event for us locals. Reporters were also waiting and there even was a live feed with the latest news. 

TUESDAY 4 PM:

After 8 hours of waiting in heavy rainfall a Model X showed up at the end of the street. 
In it, on the passenger seat, was Elon. 
The car drove immediately in the underground car park, Elon didn't even greeted the fans. The local reporters shot some pictures.
Some fans (among them my friends) were dispirited and sad because they only saw Elon for a few seconds through the car window, they left. Others didn't give up and luckily stayed.


TUESDAY 8 PM:

After hours of meetings Elon came out of the building. He was surrounded by CureVac employees and bodyguards and had a black bandana wrapped around his face.  
He walked across the field in front of the CureVac building to bath in the crowd of the (around 50) fans, who waited. 
As far as I know everybody kept distance and he only exchanged a couple of words with a few people. Many fans made selfies from a distance. 
There was a engineering student, who had a sign with the words ""I WANT TO WORK FOR YOU!"". He showed Elon a self-built fully electric motorcycle. Elon was very interested and they talked a for a while. 

After 15 minutes of interaction with fans and reporters Elon left to drive to the airport.",elonmusk

Ah yes the one‚Äôs that made millionaires out of billionaires,elonmusk
Everything he's ever done is a new product. There was no Tesla before Musk. Electric vehicles were pathetic. No cheap rockets before Musk. Space flight was massively expensive and ruled by government agencies. Number one innovator because he's taking on and successfully disrupting the industries that rule the world. Energy.

"&gt; Everything he's ever done is a new product. 

No. Maybe, arguably, a few things he's ""done"" were actually new. But not everything. Neuralink for example is nothing new. The current state of art is way ahead of what Neuralink is hoping to achieve. They have been a lot of commentaries by neuroscientists recently on this.

&gt; Electric vehicles were pathetic.  

Implicitly, you admit that electric vehicles existed before. They were not good enough for your taste. Whatever you mean by pathetic. The best thing you can say is that Tesla is about to have success in offering attractive electric vehicles. Nothing new. Just better.

&gt;   Space flight was massively expensive and ruled by government agencies. 

Again you admit that he did not invent Space Flight. He just participated in making it cheaper and more efficient, as a businessman. Here I have to admit that his role is indeed innovatory. 

All of this is still not enough to make him the leading innovator in the world. SpaceX might be his only innovation.",elonmusk

"&gt;Lockdowns were a huge mistake.

Half-assed lockdowns are a mistake.  Which is what the US did.  We never had a lockdown, we had a ""well, let's try to closed down a couple places and see what happens"".

The results from Italy's arguably draconian lockdown were undeniably real.  

&gt;For example 80% of deaths are attributed to nursing homes and other individuals that wouldn't have survived the year anyways

Got a source for this? Just because you are in a nursing home doesn't mean you are not going to survive the year.  

NY had to resort to moving elderly from hospitals to nursing homes because the hospitals were at capacity. It was a shitty  no-win situation.  What would you have done if the hospitals were full and new patients kept coming in?  Keep the elderly and deny new patients?",Futurology

"I'm arguing against the point you did take. I just applied it rhetorically to ""any issue you could ask about"" to illustrate what a ridiculous assumption it was that you made. It would be equally ridiculous to say ""well I'm sure they thought that"" as an answer to ANY engineering question, that was my point. It's a thought terminating non answer that detracts from the discussion of people actual trying to talk about the engineering problems 

&gt; And that false claim I made doesn't diminish my point in any way, it was tangential. Also, I forgot. I knew that, but forgot. That happens. Still, doesn't impact my argument.

It really does impact your argument and diminish your point, entirely. Why else would you delete it? Your only comment that said anything substantive or falsifiable, and you erase it after its easily proven false. When your whole initial point was ""I am willing to bet they thought of it"" and people ask why, and you give the reasons... 

That's not a tangent. That's called supporting your point with evidence. And when your evidence failed for being factually wrong, you deleted it and said ""ahh it was just an irrelevant tangent""

&gt; you really think they didn't have someone think ""what if something breaks down inside the tunnel?""

This is an appeal to incredulity. It doesn't matter how dumb you make it sound, people make mistakes all the time, and its valid to discuss that possibility. The burden of proof is on you, my dude. Show us the evidence of why you think they DID necessarily think of it already. Try not to delete it this time",Futurology

"This money isn't as useful to most people as they think it is.

Suppose you take all this essentially dead (not circulating) money and redistribute it.

And the greatest irony? Those that are the biggest proponents of taxation to solve this inequality problem are usually the same people that are okay with deficit spending and money creation that led to this situation in the first place.

Your position that it does not really exist seems quite at odds with reality.

Most of the constituents are farmers who take care of their own heating. Traditionally it means truckloads of coal shipped to the villages late autumn. Ever since the Paris Climate Agreement, the government massively subsidised clean coal (Sulfur-free coal powder mixed with clay) making it as cheap as dirty coal.

Lots and lots of small or medium coal mines went out of business. My cousin's office received death threats, mob attacks, assassination attempts on one of the investigation teams from the province, bribery, at one point their office building was blocked by 4 tons of cow shit. 

Eventually they stopped, presumably because they are out of business and/or Cow poo. And the few left over started rumours saying clean coal is ""less hot"" or ""poisonous"".

"You are completely wrong. Einstein's explanation has been completely verified experimentally by Robert Millikan who spent ten years trying to disprove the Law of the photoelectric effect. He confirmed Einstein's theory in **EVERY DETAIL**   He did publish his results although he was unhappy about them. Your pathetic attempt is pure nonsense.

 A photon does not exist and cannot be detected? I suggest you read up on the Compton effect which absolutely proves that it does. 
 Over and over again Einstein's work has been verified experimentally.
 The photon anti-bunching effect is another experiment that shows photons exist. These three things kick your claim of no such thing as a photon right in the balls. I can just see you bent over clutching your crotch right now.

BTW Einstein dealt with the emission of electrons and he was responsible for classification of the duality of light waves and particles (photons) which no one had done before. It was his insight of light as particles that led to a major contribution in quantum mechanics. 

 &gt;I will not find a single highly regarded physicist that claims photons are real. 

How about Einstein himself? Or https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03280 (Hope you have a subscription.) He is more highly acclaimed than anyone you can cite to the contrary. 

https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Challenge-Second-Foundations-Mechanics/dp/076372470X/ Here is some *light* reading about the reality of photons.

Classical theory cannot explain the six experimental results found in the area of research.  Only one of them.  Einstein's theory does explain them all.. 


The number of electrons emitted increases as you increase the intensity of the light. (Higher intensity means more total energy, which means more photons. More photons means more electrons knocked loose.)

The energy of the electrons emitted does not depend on the intensity at all. (The electron energy is whatever's left of a single photon energy after you supply the energy needed for the work function. The total number of photons has nothing to do with it.)

As you vary the frequency of the light, you find that there is a frequency below which no electrons are emitted, no matter how high an intensity you use. (If the photon energy is less than the energy required to free an electron, it doesn't matter how many photons you throw at the system, nothing's going to happen.)

Above the cutoff frequency, the energy of the electrons emitted increases linearly as you increase the frequency. (The higher the frequency, the higher the photon energy, and the higher the photon energy, the more energy is left for the electron.)

There's no time delay. No matter how low you make the intensity, if electrons are emitted at all, they come out instantly. (One photon is all it takes. You don't need to build up energy slowly.)

If you keep a constant intensity, and vary the frequency, you find fewer electrons coming out at higher frequencies. (Intensity is a measure of the total energy in the beam. If you increase the frequency, you increase the energy per photon, and thus need fewer photons to make up the same total energy. Fewer photons means fewer electrons.)

This is always the problem with nuclear power, there are lots of opposition and no vocal support, so anti-nuclear movement always use false arguments nobody will bother to contradict.

(The one time I've ridden a western Canadian train, a trip scheduled for 22 hours become 42 because of freight train delays. Obviously this is not a practical option for anyone engaging in anything but leisure tourism)

 In my particular province, Saskatchewan, (which is very small, but still relevant) we have literally ZERO bus outside of cities. Our government defunded our already small public bus service, and this caused Greyhound (private contractor) to also completely withdraw from our market. This is in a place where it is possible to die of exposure (freeze to death) during 6 months of the year. It's essentially neo-feudalism. People without cars are literally welded to the land.

But what about planes? Well ignoring the economic cost (low cost carriers dont exist here really, Regina &gt; Calgary is the shortest route I'd feasibly fly and I dont think it ever goes below 400$) at least one of our two airports is totally inaccessible by foot: there is not even a city bus line going there.

A huge part of the problem in Canada and America is the false equivalence that ""car = freedom"" which is a message encouraged and pushed by governments and oil lobbies.

What makes this even worse: Western Canadian cars are actually specially modified with block heaters, and most people drive pick up trucks. It gets so cold here that in the winter people need to start their car 10-15 minutes in advance of driving for the engine to be able to run. A natural consequence of this is that it's also common for people to leave their car running for fairly long periods of time in the winter when they go into the store/are running errands etc. So not only do we use our cars more than (probably) anywhere else in the world, we also drive some of the worst vehicles and have some of the worst practices in terms of pollution.",Futurology

The same way whacking something with a hammer repeatedly gets you a lot more small pieces in the long run than bug ones, you end up with a lot more small chains than big ones, and the smaller chains are really only useful for fuel on a large scale. Plastics are really long chains, so to get them to the right length usually ends up with a lot more smaller pieces, and sticking things back together really isn't feasible in terms of cost.

As a surveillance measure they MIGHT be useful around urban or high traffic wilderness areas, but that introduces all sorts of safety, privacy and noise issues.

"Thanks for the response. Here are some thoughts as I read through:
&gt;Climate change causes forest fuels (the organic matter that burns and spreads wildfire) to be more dry, and has doubled the number of large fires between 1984 and 2015 in the western United States.

This is blatantly poorly stated. The climate did not warm up enough to ignite anything. This should be stated as ""climate change made fire that have started be more difficult to contain and put out."" But the climate did not ignite anything. 1st paragraph.

Paragraph 2 clarified this, but logical readers would have turned off based on the lie in paragraph one. 

Later on in the article, it states that 2017 was abonormally bad, but that was also when california didn't do very much controlled burn. Those may be related, but I think the reason they didn't do controlled burn could be the uncontrolled burning happening. I would have to look at a calendar and a timeline to determine that. I mentioned the lack of burns in a different reply.

It mentions monetary damage, but that isn't a really good metric (note, it isn't a bad one, but it is easily distorted when talking climate change). Once you set a 100 story building on fire, the dollar value is taken as gospel, as in 1 acre you took out a billion dollar building, but that is irrelevant to climate change when you are referring to dry soil and things like that. granted, wind can help spread, but again, I think that stat goes back to and better with acreage.

The recommendations at the bottom of the article are worth discussion though:
&gt;Communities, builders, homeowners, and forest managers can reduce the likelihood and impacts of wildfires by:
&gt;Discouraging developments (especially residential) near fire-prone forests through smart zoning rules.
This seems smart. Don't build in high wind plane areas without natural water access.

&gt;Increasing the space between structures and nearby trees and brush, and clearing space between neighboring houses.
Encourages sprawl, which makes things worse?

&gt;Incorporating fire-resistant design features and materials in buildings.
Mandated by building code for a long... long... time (I am in construction)

&gt;Increasing resources allocated to firefighting and fire prevention.
Funding is always good.

&gt;Removing fuels, such as dead trees, from forests that are at risk.
This seems to be much more important. Removing the fuel stops the fire. Based on a previous reply, I think California is failing here.

&gt;Developing recovery plans before a fire hits, and implementing plans quickly after a fire to reduce erosion, limit flooding, and minimize habitat damage.
Good planning always helps.

And, for example, living in a country like Ukraine, $1,500 a month is more like $5-6k in the US.

Gasoline cars were originally completely mechanical devices, and with advent of electrical computers became more efficient and powerfull.

&gt;Typically, explained Schiweck, ""Heart rates are higher during the day and lower at night.""

This change seems to be a new way of determining if a patient is at risk to develop depression or deteriorate. 

Seems to be saying if your heart rate is always 'up' even when sleeping that shows a correlation with depression.



If you're depressed it's hard to sleep and when you do sleep your dreams would likely relate to all the issues making you depressed which could dump some adrenaline while sleeping leading to less restful sleep which would make depression even more likely.

But even if it is depression causing the elevated heart rates, it's good to have a quantifiable measurement for depression.",Futurology

"Sadly there do not appear to be any summary sources (at least that showed up in a quick Google). You can read about the controversy surrounding Zenn to get some background. Then after that it's just catching scams as they pop up, over and over.

There are, for instance,  kickstarter pages constantly popping up, but most of them get taken down as scams by the crowdfunding companies, so they leave no lasting impression on the internet. There are webpages for these ultracap scams popping in and out of existence all the time, but unless they happen to get archived by a third party they also leave no lasting impression online. Easy come, easy go.

The best thing you can do on short notice is, I suppose, to read up about the differences between capacitors (of all types) and batteries, and why they're different. Wikipedia gives a good summary on them, and the listed sources at the bottom of the page make for good further reading. I'll do a short summary for you below to lay out the basics of why these types of scams are just as impossible as a free energy scam.
____
Basically, capacitors (*especially* ultracaps) have an exceptionally high power density, but an exceptionally low energy density the (I'll explain the difference in a moment). Batteries are the opposite, though modern lithium ion designs have an impressive (though still quite modest) power density to go along with their high energy density.

Power density is (basically) the speed at which you can charge and discharge an energy storage device. Energy density is the amount of energy it can store per unit of mass or volume. So power is speed, energy is amount. Capacitors are fast, batteries store a lot. Batteries are slow, capacitors store little.

Power density and energy density are (roughly, more or less) inversely proportional. As you increase one you decrease the other. You may be able to eventually very careful design a battery with a few times greater power density than current batteries, but there is a practical limit. You may be able to eventually design an ultracapacitor with a few times higher energy density, but the starting point of modern ultracaps is so low that that wouldn't really get you anywhere useful (at least not for mass storage).

As a rough, somewhat inaccurate analogy, imagine two tubs of water. One is very shallow, the other is very deep. You can fill the shallow one up very quickly, but you can't store much in it. You can store a lot in the deep one, but it can't be filled very quickly specifically because it is so deep. You can make the shallow one wider and wider to store more water, but eventually it grows to the size that it's cumbersome to use. You can make it much deeper instead, but then you're taking away the very thing that made it quick to fill compared to the deep tub: its shallowness.

Similarly, if you increase the energy density of an ultracapacitor enough to make it useful for large-scale energy storage, and you've kept its ""shallowness"" so that it's quick to fill, it's now obnoxiously large. Look at a Tesla grid storage megapack, then imagine it thousands of times bigger.

The other choice is to keep the size small but then sacrifice power density until the energy density gets up to an acceptable level. Congratulations, you've just invented the battery! At this point you've just created a much shittier, more expensive type of battery than a lithium ion battery - worse even than an old-school lead-acid battery.
____
That's the basic conundrum. Ultracapacitors are fast but shallow, batteries are deep but slow. You can use little design tricks to make each a bit better - in our water tub analogy you could taper the edges, for instance - but fundamentally the two technologies are good for opposite applications. 

Batteries work well for grid storage because you don't need massive amounts of power (but small amounts of energy) delivered or stored in a fraction of a second, instead you need a lot of energy stored over a long period of time (hours or days), then dribbled out to the grid as required.",Futurology
"Ideally industry will transition to hydrogen, leaving natural gas in the domestic space.

https://xkcd.com/605/

Read this.

This is what you're doing when you say things like this:

&gt; You were aware that the 2019/2020 Australian wildfires approximately doubled their CO2 emissions over the last year?

Year to year wildfire sizes fluctuate considerably.

For example, in the United States, in 2012, over 9 million acres were burned. In 2013, less than 4 million acres were burned. In 2014, that was down to just over 3 million acres burned.

According to your ""logic"", the size of wildfires in the US had decreased by over 60% in two years!

But in reality, this is fluctuation. 2015 saw 10 million acres of land burned.

There is an upward trend, but trying to use year to year data like this is completly wrong and no one with even the most basic level of background in statistics would do it.

The fact that you're making this error means that you don't really understand how to deal with data like this at all, and you should probably severely ramp down your confidence in your beliefs.

You can [manipulate](https://wildfiretoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Acres-burned-wildfire-US.jpg) the [trendline](https://wildfiretoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Acres-all-50-states-1986-2012.jpg) by arbitrarily picking different start and end dates.

&gt; One factor in the recent fires is almost certainly inadequate forest management, but it is far from the only factor.

I didn't say it was the only factor. I said it was a large factor.

It is a larger factor than global warming is.

But global warming is a factor as well.

Year to year fluctuations are caused by variations in climactic conditions.

&gt; Of the estimated eight million species on Earth, a million are now threatened with extinction, one expert warns.

These numbers are entirely made up.

There are 41,415 species on the IUCN redlist, of which 16,306 of them are endangered species threatened with extinction

https://www.endangeredearth.com/#:~:text=THE%20PLIGHT%20OF%20ENDANGERED%20SPECIES%3A,endangered%20animals%20and%20endangered%20plants.

People constantly fabricate numbers like these which have zero scientific basis.

&gt; Since 1970, vertebrate animals - birds, mammals, reptiles, fish and amphibians - have declined by 60%, another tells us.

This is also fabricated. I literally pointed this out elsewhere in the thread.

https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2018/11/animal-decline-living-planet-report-conservation-news/

It's an example of abuse of statistics.

That's not to say that the number of wild animals is not in decline - it is - but the number you're citing is flat-out false. It isn't what the number means.

As explained in the article:

&gt; Let‚Äôs say for example you have 50 tigers, 200 falcons, and 10,000 squirrels. Let‚Äôs say the first population declines by 90 percent, to 5 tigers. The second declines 80 percent, to 40 falcons. And the squirrels drop to 9,000‚Äîa 10 percent fall. That‚Äôs a 60 percent average decline of these three fictitious populations, but only a total decline of 12 percent of the individuals.

Again, you don't understand this stuff at all.

&gt; You seem stuck in an anti-malthusian mindset. A view that where, just because something has never happened before, then it can't possibly ever happen.

You are indistinguishable from the followers of Harold Camping.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Camping

Repeated failed prophecies, repeated scrambling to try and find another date for the apocaylpse and a new justification for it.

Repeated failure.

But you don't abandon it, because your belief in the apocalypse was never based on logic, it is based purely on faith.

This is why you're getting so upset at me - because I'm challenging your core belief in an upcoming apocalypse.

You need to accept that you've been indoctrinated into an apocalyptic cult, and get out of it.

The entire idea of a Malthusian catastrophe is completely false. It's not how reality works.

Here's how science works: you make a prediction, and you test it.

If your hypothesis repeatedly fails, it means you're wrong, and you need to abandon it.

This is precisely what has happened.

In real life, per capita agricultural productivity has been going up steadily because of improvements in technology.

Which is exactly what scientists predicted.

&gt; So we keep using fossil fuels? You might have missed the whole, IPCC project this path puts us on a 3C+ warming track. That is widely regarded as incompatible with organised human civilisation.

Nope. Only the cult members believe that global warming will end civilization.

There's no scientific basis for that belief whatsoever.

Indeed, the entire idea is *obviously* delusional.

Seriously. THINK.

Humans live in regions that differ by far more than 3 degrees centigrade in average annual temperature *right now*.

In fact, humans live in regions that differ by more than *20 degrees centigrade* in average annual temperature. People live in places like Anchorage, Alaska and Phoenix, Arizona.

The idea that three degrees centigrade of difference will cause global civilization to collapse is completely irrational.

It's not grounded in logic or reason, let alone science.

"What you're saying is true for a closed system. But a house is not a closed system. There is a continuous heat exchange between inside and outside, and with a contained refrigeration gas that expands and contracts we can use the ideal gas law to our benefit. Now, it only works as long as the temperatures are within the the temperature range the refrigeration gas can operate at, but if it is we can move heat rather than create it. 

Take that example of yours, when moving heat from inside to outside the AC would pump gas from the interior pipes to the exterior pipes. This lowers the pressure of the interior refrigeration gas pipes and cools the gas in the interior pipes which in turn cools the room. In the exterior pipes on the other hand, the pressure rises and, by the ideal gas law, so does the heat and the pipes that heating up the outside. This is why the back of the refrigerator or freezer gets hot.

Now obviously that doesn't work in a vacuum. Not on it's own, but that is why they hook it up to heat radiators in space stations.",Futurology
"is flaring the least bad option? No.

Gas price is currently too cheap to profit? Yes, but here is the thing. Flaring should be more expensive because of the damage to the environment. A carbon tax would give more incentives to the oil companies to sell their natural gas instead of burning it themselves, even at a small loss. Also, regulation of methane is absolutely needed because even if not the best, flaring is far better than letting the methane into the atmosphere. 

The government should give incentives for selling the gas instead of flaring and regulations for flaring the gas instead of venting.",Futurology

But they are definitely not clean. Outside of redundant power generation, I don't think they have a place in our current society. We can easily meet our needs with solar, wind and hydro power at a fraction of the cost, with a fraction of the pollution, with a fraction of chance of contamination.

As you pointed out the U.S. spend significantly more per capita then we do in Canada.  for significantly less results.  I'm certainly not arguing that fact.

Also your ignorance of how the Corruption Perceptions Index is calculated is showing.  Perhaps a little more research and you would realize that Transparency International uses expert assessments to calculate their index every year.

 CPI takes into account 16 different surveys and assessments from 12 different institutions.   The 13 surveys/assessments are either business people opinion surveys or performance assessments from a group of analysts.

While it is true the CPI used public opinion survey's prior to 2012, they stopped doing that and only used trusted experts to calculate their index ranking since 2012.

And hey, Canada isn't perfect.  We are currently 12th on the index of most corrupt countries so we have room to improve (which we are doing as we went up 2 points since last year)... mind you the U.S. fell to 23, dropping 2 points last year so you seem to be moving in the wrong direction.",Futurology
"Average incomes declined because the post war boom we had ended. After world war two europe was in ruins, and asia was barely developed. In the years right after the war the US alone accounted for fifty percent of global gdp. Fifty percent! Today we account for 15%. 

So that allowed us to build a massive middle class. The lower population helped too, because land was less desirable. That's why boomers could buy houses and put their kids through college on a factory workers pay. 

Trickle down is not and never was an actual economic theory espoused by any economist or even reagan himself. Seriously. Go try and find any economist using that term non pejoratively. You won't because no one did. 

&gt; The US stopped taxing the rich and corporations, so now the middle class or below gets to pay all the taxes.

That is not even close to being true. The top twenty percent of income earners in this country pay 87% of all federal income taxes. You want to take a guess what percentage the bottom fifty percent pay? 

&gt; Productivity, meanwhile, has gone up at least 6 times since then

Right. But increased productivity means fewer jobs almost by definition. Automation, offshoring manafacturing, and massive influxes of low skilled immigrants both legal and illegal was the final nail in the coffin.

Costs for technology have gone down by many orders of magnitude. Computers used to be $10,000. In fact, most consumer goods are much, much cheaper now thanks largely to offshoring manafacturing, and just in time supply chains. 

Now the middle class is growing in the developing world while its shrinking here. You could argue BECAUSE it's shrinking here. But is it fair that a family in bangladesh gets indoor plumbing and wifi while the us middle class shrinks? Kind of a tough to say a factory worker here who lives like a king compared to that family deserves those gains more.",Futurology

"Limiting hardware so that manufacturers can sell a single model at different price points is done in countless industries as normal practice, and most of the population is oblivious to it. The caveat, generally, is that enabling the disabled features often voids warranties and comes with additional risk. The warranty has a value. 

The company can offer free updates, and people can judge a company for selling software locked tiers of performance. They are mutually exclusive. The 'correct' solution would be to 'average' the prices of all the tesla software features and change the minimum price of a tesla vehicle to incorporate that. Do customers want the freedom of a cheaper Tesla by not paying for features they don't want? Or would they rather everyone be forced to pay for features they may not need so that those that want the feature can pay less? This also could help people enjoy features they wouldn't have paid for otherwise, who may then end up enjoying the car even more.

The fuel cell does help to an extent, but you can't really replace the internal combustion engine in cars with fuel cells and so you need batteries, which negates the efficiency boost.

"There have been instances of people who were blinded as children recovering sight as adults. They are still effectively blind in many ways because their brain cannot process visual information. They have difficulty recognizing familiar people and objects. Being able to visually scan and then explore your environment, for example, is necessary to form depth perception, which is just one component of vision. If you're unable to do that during formative years, then, yes, you will lose the ability to do so later on. If you put a child in a dark room alone during their formative years, you will effectively blind them even if nothing was originally wrong with their eyes or brain. If you dont use it during development, you lose it.

What ultimately happens is that the person has vision but the brain can't process it. We see this in children with cortical visual impairments (vision loss resulting from an issue with the brain, not an issue with the eyes itself). You really have a small portion of time to build the neurons that enable meaningful sight, which is why we do so many interventions just to get them to intentionally gaze at a target. This gets much more difficult as the individual gets older and their brain is less able to form the connections needed.

Solar-panels make sense when you are putting them on already-existing man-made structures, e.g. on top of buildings.  
  
But what you suggest, a coop buying land, is egregious environmental damage because thee most precious resources is habitat. Solar-panels also produce waste of an as-of-yet unknown toxicity. The environmental consequences of the nano-particles are not known.  
  
For wind-mills the environmental damage is know as they produce an astounding 36 tonnes of hazardous fiber-glass waste every 10 to 12 years because the blade-assemblies wear-out on-top-of their egregious land use. The notion of putting them in the water is an *even worse* idea as 11/12^th of the shallow ocean habitat has already been destroyed.  
  
A roll-out of solar and/or wind to furfill baseload and peak would be an environmental catastrophe destroying more of what little habitat remains. Solar and wind **ARE NOT SOLUTIONS**. They cause more damage.  
  
The best course of action is nuclear for baseload and natural-gas for peak. Natural-gas burns 4x clearner than oil or coal - that is a **massive** improvement. The thorium decay chain is preferred but failing that then uranium it is. This needs to hold us over until fusion-power is commercialized.

But today‚Äôs reality/next best alternative is a ‚Äòcheap‚Äô grid that costs us ‚Äònothing‚Äô.  And good luck getting anybody here to give up our park....

And for these pesky losses in power we suffer once or twice a year, a whole home back up generator with install will cost me $6500.  My gas line and electrical box are right off the garage for really easy install...

But if i had all the money in the world... I would spend $100,000 to get something that could fully be off grid... Probably wouldn‚Äôt live where i live either though",Futurology

"That's an absolute straw man of an argument. No one is advocating lower housing costs because it is fair and they have a right. What they are advocating for is that housing costs reflect market values and aren't dictated by forces with zero oversight or limitations. Keep in mind how bad it is for the economy to have a stifled housing market. For one, we have foreign investors who literally just buy up property and let it sit because it is a way to keep equity and wealth out of the hands of their respective governments (looking at you China.) When that happens the house becomes dead weight on the economy because there is no flow of capital apart from property taxes. It would be an entirely different argument if they were rental properties but they are not. That is just one problem, the other is when you have massive rental corporations buying up entire tracts of housing for the sake of a monopoly. In a free market if you were renting from someone and they exorbitantly hiked up your rental prices, you could give them the finger and find a better deal. But when that company owns every home in the area, there is no competition and they have created a monopolistic feedback loop allowing them to charge whatever they want because there is no alternative.

You keep saying that it lies solely with personal responsibility when it doesn't. Yes people can be smarter with their money, but that doesn't excuse the obvious manipulation of the market.

What's amazing to me is that the same type of people screaming about doing whatever it takes to fight off climate change balk at the cost of nuclear despite nuclear being better than every solution even in the best case scenario.  

This is what makes me speculative about all of the investments we're making into wind and solar because even in a BEST CASE scenario, it's still not even going to hit closes to what nuclear does already.

To build a nuclear power plant, the costs are between 6 billion dollars and 9 billion dollars.  In the past 10 years, there has been a 2.6 TRILLION DOLLAR investment in other clean energy solutions.  The amount of nuclear power plants we could have built with that amount of money could have replaced the entire US power generation with nuclear.

If the grid fails, you have no power. That is the situation right now and that is pretty archaic. At this point in tech, it is cheap and easy to implement alternative energy to your own house.

Why do we use AC in our house? Because it is easier to move electricity long distances in this form. Not because it is best for the citizen. Big companies are not going to make decisions that are best for the citizen. They were raking it in with coal. That is why we are having such difficulty moving out of it.

1. The damage they can cause if they are not maintained overtime eg: budget cuts

2. Target for terrorists attacks or bombing ( eg: poor nations where defense of these structures may not be guaranteed over 50 years )

3. Nuclear is the optimal solution for space travel, energy dense, creates heat and can breed alternative elements. I really believe we should save this for this purpose.

4.  Storage of waste, why make something so hard to deal with in the first place?

5. The Limited supply. If we completely transition to this we have say 200 years of fuel assuming the population keeps growing. 

6. Fuel supply chain. Remove oil and substitute nuclear fuel, ready for invasions to keep the power on.

So you will have to unpack your statement a little more clearly with references ideally.

You also haven't done your calculations on the potential of EV storage. Say you have an ev runabout car. You can tell your car that you need only 20 miles range on any one day  so that leaves 95% of that cars battery free for storage. If half of all cars are like this then it still supplies a massive amount of strorage - given most countries are switch to all ev's by 2035. Due to a potential pay back scheme and the low degradation of modern batteries EV owners are keen to implement this scheme.

Another simple way around it is to over supply wind and solar so that the country is usually at 100% renewables and if some strange drop of wind occurs you may have to switch a lot of gas power back on - but still over the year you are at 80% or above renewables. 

Another way I believe you are incorrect is the recent incredibly low price of electricity storage means that wind plus storage looks to be about the same price as levelised gas costs.

There is a long way to go in reducing the carbon footprint of the industry, but a complete abandonment of plastic products is not entirely feasible right now.

Biodegradable hemp plastics, and other natural materials, can have their place in some applications, but I doubt anyone wants their car, household appliances, or other objects rotting out from under them.  Plastic can be a useful and valuable product for our society, we just need to learn how to better use, re-use and recycle it.  Throwing it out of car windows, or leaving it on beaches, etc. is a human issue, not a material one.",Futurology

"Environmental scientist here. Primitivism and degrowth cannot physically solve climate change. It's bizarre that so many of my colleagues have such a huge blind spot on this issue and make this error so often. These are ideologically-driven, not evidence based.

Although the details are debated, it seems likely that as long as CO2 concentration is above natural equilibrium of around 280ppm, we will have continued climate change impacts including melting ice sheets and sea level rise. 

This ""inertia"" in the system means that even if all new GHG emissions dropped to zero tomorrow, we would still have catastrophic impacts from climate change due to the &gt;400ppm CO2 already in the atmosphere. Since it would take at least decades and maybe centuries for natural equilibrium ppm to be restored, climate change is still a huge problem for many decades *even if all humans disappeared tomorrow*.

Lifestyle changes that reduce emissions by reducing consumption don't pull even a single gram of CO2 out of the atmosphere. So they are not a real solution for climate change. Planting trees is of course a good idea, but it cannot sequester enough carbon to fully return us to 280ppm.

It is far too late to solve climate change with primitivism and austerity.

Our only chance to really prevent climate change impacts now is gigantic global CO2 withdrawal megaprojects. We need to take 500+ gigatons of carbon out of the atmosphere within two or three decades, or we will still face catastrophic impacts.

We can't do those megaprojects by destroying the global economy and returning to the trees. Our only chance now is to maintain a thriving economy and focus on technological engineering solutions. The opportunity to solve climate change with social changes alone expired 10-20 years ago.",Futurology

I like that these kids are trying to bring change. But they're unloading the creativity and ingenuity needed for that change onto someone else.  

Suing other countries is great. But what do you expect them to do?   With what solutions? Funded by who's money?  Impacting the citizens and children of those countries as well no doubt.  

The easiest thing in the world is to speak up, but it usually doesn't go any farther than that.

The one protection is access to beaches   for which you can cross private property, and that is also under attack from lobbyists that want it changed.

"Communism and other ideologies of greed and resentment are pastology, the kind that kills hundreds of millions of people. Why does someone deserve 50 billion dollars? Because people valued the product or service they offered that much. You don't get anything by capping wealth besides those hyper productive and hyper valuable people stopping producing once they reach that cap. It helps literally no one.

People who think like this need to learn economics. Money isn't some tangible you can redistribute without consequence. Money is tied to people's labour and what they are willing to work for and pay for, once you arbitrarily limit or create perverse incentives you fuck everything up and have cascade consequences. Does Jeff Bezos have *ANY* affect on your buying power as an individual? No. He has multiple hundreds of thousands of times more buying power than you, but if that money were redistributed the buying power of everyone in society remains exactly the same.

"&gt; The figre I'm talking about is from here, and is not the one you talk about. Belgium, France and Sweden did the fastest decarbonization effort to date per capita - and France showing how to do it in large scale.

It's essentially the same data I was criticizing, but without the unfortunate 10-year averaging. It still suffers from the same fundamental problem: in the past, any decarbonization was *necessarily* driven by hydro, nuclear or geothermal because wind and solar *used to be very expensive*. It says very little about recent dynamics.

&gt; Going from your other comment, this is also very misleading. Decentralized intermittent renewables face other issues than cost. Just look at the recent development speed of renewables in Germany for the last few years - rapidly slowing down wind turbine buildout, despite the cost being way lower than it was 10 years ago.

It's the problem of a densely populated region, which played even more strongly against nuclear, and it's specifically about onshore wind. It's unfortunate and I hope it's only a temporary problem, and I wouldn't use Germany's NIMBYism as an argument for nuclear ;)",Futurology

# Backstory

When I saw Elon Musk tear up on¬†60 Minutesfacing the verbal assault from one of his heroes ‚Äî Apollo astronaut Gene Cernan ‚Äî I knew what I had to do.

It has taken a bit of effort over the past months, but today I gave this to Elon and all of the SpaceX team, and it was very well received.


When I saw 60 Minutes, my first thought was to get Gene Cernan (the last man to walk on the moon) to visit SpaceX as Elon had implored. I have been buying¬†space artifactsfrom Gene over the past year and knew how to reach him. I tried to encourage him to visit SpaceX, but to no avail. So I flew out to talk to him face to face. I waited until SpaceX became the first private company to bring a spacecraft back from orbit, and the first to bring cargo to the space station, and the first to bring science experiments back. I also gathered signatures and congratulatory sentiments from the other Apollo heroes first.

Some, like Charlie Duke and Al Bean, were effusive in their praise of SpaceX and the next generation of space explorers. Charlie Duke was excited about a future mission to Mars. Al Bean spent 20 minutes writing rough drafts and crafting each word of his message with the SpaceX team in mind.

Then I approached Gene Cernan, and held my breath. I figured it would be a bit more difficult to break from the social proof of his esteemed colleagues. And so he listened. As with every Apollo astronaut who signed this photo, I was able to talk about SpaceX and answer his questions. Gene was interested in who financed SpaceX ‚Äî what big money interests got it going. I told him that Elon Musk personally financed the company for all of its first $100 million, when no one else would bet on the venture, and he saw it through thick and thin, including the first three launches of the Falcon 1, all of which failed spectacularly. As I told him these stories of heroic entrepreneurship, I could see his mind turning. He found a reconciliation: ‚ÄúI never read any of this in the news. Why doesn‚Äôt the press report on this?‚Äù

Cernan was the last hold out.¬†Neil Armstrong wrote a strongly worded letter to 60 Minutes saying that he was taken out of context. The program editor agreed: ""Armstrong wrote us to say we had not been complete in our description of his testimony. He's right.

&gt;Armstrong is, arguably, the greatest explorer of the 20th Century. I suspect he has admiration for anyone in science or business who sees new possibilities. He may not be confident in a particular federal policy, but I imagine Neil Armstrong stands squarely on the side of those who dare to dream.""

"It depends. Russian Oligarchs, for example, don't come by their billions honestly. As for Jeff Bezos, it can be argued that he doesn't take a proactive enough role in changing the world for the better. Most billionaires like him just have a ""one-and-done"" business which is the source of their wealth. The way Elon is different is that he has always dumped all of his assets back into his companies: the 21/22 million from the Zip2 sale went into the X.com/Paypal online banking, then all of the money from that went into SpaceX and Tesla. He doesn't actually have any wealth that is not stock in his companies. He literally takes out loans that use his stock as collateral to buy wealthy-person things. 

Taxing someone Elon, and taxing some billionaire who has made their money by corrupt oil or tax-payer money from lobbying or the money from oppressed citizens (looking at you CCP), are two different things.",elonmusk

"Some slight corrections as I made the post in a hurry without checking multiple sources

( All of them are in the general neighbourhood though , so both might be true as they paraded it around a bit ).

* It might not have been to get the attention of the FAA specifically , but NASA and the government in general.

&gt;The pending launch ignited Musk‚Äôs salesman instincts. He wanted to show the public what his tireless workers had accomplished and drum up some excitement around SpaceX. Musk decided to unveil a prototype of Falcon 1 to the public in December 2003. The company would haul the seven-story-high Falcon 1 across the country on a specially built rig and leave it‚Äîand the SpaceX mobile launch system‚Äîoutside of the Federal Aviation Administration‚Äôs headquarters in Washington, D.C. An accompanying press conference would make it clear to Washington that a modern, smarter, cheaper rocket maker had arrived.

"Thanks for pointing to it. There's a lot more details in this one.

&gt;Washington snubbed Musk just as it had Beal. The establishment‚Äîthe large contractors, members of Congress, even many in NASA‚Äîsaw him as just another multimillionaire with a toy space company. A dilettante who couldn‚Äôt possibly succeed. Few took Musk seriously.

&gt;‚ÄúAt the beginning, we had to beg NASA to even pay attention,‚Äù recalled Lawrence Williams, SpaceX‚Äôs vice president of strategic relations at the time.

&gt;By the end of 2003, Musk decided that if NASA wouldn‚Äôt come to him, he would go to it. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was preparing to celebrate the hundredth anniversary of the Wright Brothers‚Äô first powered flight with a party at the National Air and Space Museum, and Musk decided he‚Äôd show up‚Äîand bring his new rocket.

&gt;For the event, SpaceX loaded the seven-story rocket onto the back of a custom trailer and hauled it cross-country to Washington, DC. With a police escort, it paraded down Independence Avenue, along the National Mall, hallowed ground that had been witness to myriad spectacles, marches, protests. But it had never seen anything quite like this.

&gt;As Musk, then thirty-two years old, parked his rocket outside the headquarters of the FAA, tourists who were headed to the National Air and Space Museum stopped to gawk at the streetside exhibit, even in the freezing temperatures. A shiny, white missile that stretched seven stories long, squatting in the real estate usually reserved for hot dog vendors. A cabbie stopped, agog, as the trailer took up an entire lane of traffic‚Äîat rush hour. The spectacle was pure Silicon Valley swagger, like an Apple product unveiling, but before Steve Jobs had perfected the art of hyping a new gadget to the masses.

&gt;...\*details about the press event*...

&gt;And so this spectacle on the National Mall was more than just a debut for his new rocket. It was a warning shot to such companies as Lockheed Martin and Boeing. Beal had not been able to break their vise grip on the industry. But Musk was armed with a new rocket, and a newly minted fortune that he was ready to burn.

&gt;He was coming for them.",elonmusk

"When weather permitted it was more like 80-90+.

Paid off a house, brought my credit up from 300s to almost 800, and paid off 6 figure medical debt (yay murica.)

I was laid up almost a year before i got that job while my wife worked 2 jobs as we continued to fall behind.

I somehow along the way discovered personal financing and investing books.  Then business and real estate investing books along with it.

That shit sucked and I'm far from rich but I'm comfortably making my way to early retirement.  My only bad debt will be a $650mo mortgage pretty soon.  If things keep going the way i hope i won't even have bills besides cellphones and internet in 5 years.

I was raised to work hard.  Harder than anyone around me.  It wasn't bad advice.  Just old advice.  I'm proud of the work I've done and it's made it boatloads easier to turn that work ethic from swinging hammers and wrenches into book/real life experiences investing.

It's okay to work hard.  As long as you have a good reason for it and don't get burned out.  If you have the stomach for it there are tons of easier ways to make a living then punching a time clock and buying shiny shit with credit just to make you happy enough to continue the cycle.",elonmusk

On the credibility of that story...

* **Single Source** : The story only comes from two interviews with his estranged father , Errol Musk, in Business Insider SA ( one of which he linked ) , [here](https://www.businessinsider.co.za/how-elon-musks-family-came-to-own-an-emerald-mine-2018-2) and [here](https://www.businessinsider.co.za/elon-musk-sells-the-family-emeralds-in-new-york-2018-2). You will find other articles also but all of them reference back to these two. That's the only source of this , his father.

* **Cartoonish Nature of Story** : Just read the interview and see if you want to believe his cartoonish tales of him being some globe trotting Pablo Escobar like character , mines sending uncut gems directly to their shareholders instead of money , and stories of nationwide jewellery retailer ( Tiffany &amp; Co.¬†on Fifth Avenue in New York ) buying uncut stones from random 16 year olds off the street ( hint : they don't , maybe your local pawn shop might but these companies have supply chains ). **Seriously , read it yourself.**

* **Reason for lying** : In each of the two interviews , the point of the story was to come to the conclusion , as shown in the below excerpts from the same ,

 &gt;It was that lifestyle, Errol says, that turned Elon into the kind of merchant adventurer who would later¬†break the rules of the motoring business¬†with Tesla, then go on to¬†change spaceflight with SpaceX. ( *From first interview* )

"&gt;Has he actually made any considerable progress on the brain implants that wasn't already there?

Good writeup on the integration involved.

&gt;For a device that small, the team packed an admirable array of features into it. The ‚ÄúLink‚Äù device has over 1,000 channels, which can be individually activated. This is on par with¬†Neuropixel, the cr√®me de la cr√®me of neural probes with 960 recording channels that‚Äôs currently used widely in research, including by the Allen Institute for Brain Science.

&gt;Compared to the Utah Array, a legendary implant system used for brain stimulation in humans with only 256 electrodes, the Link has an obvious edge up in terms of pure electrode density.

&gt;What‚Äôs perhaps most impressive, however, is its onboard processing for neural spikes‚Äîthe electrical pattern generated by neurons when they fire. Electrical signals are fairly chaotic in the brain, and filtering spikes from noise, as well as separating trains of electrical activity into spikes, normally requires quite a bit of processing power. This is why in the lab, neural spikes are usually recorded offline and processed using computers, rather than with on-board electronics.

&gt;The problem gets even more complicated when considering wireless data transfer from the implanted device to an external smartphone. Without accurate and efficient compression of those neural data, the transfer could tremendously lag, drain battery life, or heat up the device itself‚Äîsomething you don‚Äôt want happening to a device stuck inside your skull.

&gt;To get around these problems, the team has been working on algorithms that use ‚Äúcharacteristic shapes‚Äù of electrical patterns that look like spikes to efficiently identify individual neural firings. The data is processed on the chip inside the skull device. Recordings from each channel are filtered to root out obvious noise, and the spikes are then detected in real time. Because different types of neurons have their characteristic ways of spiking‚Äîthat is, the ‚Äúshape‚Äù of their spikes are diverse‚Äîthe chip can also be configured to detect the particular spikes you‚Äôre looking for. This means that in theory the chip could be programmed to only capture the type of neuron activity you‚Äôre interested in‚Äîfor example, to look at inhibitory neurons in the cortex and how they control neural information processing.

&gt;These processed spike data are then sent out to smartphones or other external devices through Bluetooth to enable wireless monitoring. Being able to do this efficiently has been a stumbling block in wireless brain implants‚Äîraw neural recordings are too massive for efficient transfer, and automated spike detection and compression of that data is difficult, but a necessary step to allow neural interfaces to finally ‚Äúcut the wire.‚Äù

&gt;Link has other impressive features. For one, the battery life lasts all day, and the device can be charged at night using inductive charging. From my subsequent conversations with the team, it seems like there will be alignment lights to help track when the charger is aligned with the device. What‚Äôs more, the Link itself also has an internal temperature sensor to monitor for over-heating, and will automatically disconnect if the temperature rises above a certain threshold‚Äîa very necessary safety measure so it doesn‚Äôt overheat the surrounding skull tissue.

"**On Paypal**

Elon founded a company called X.com which later merged with another called coinfinity, which was co-founded by Peter Thiel. X constituted half the post-merger equity and more than half the employees of the merged company which later became PayPal. He lead the company in it's formative years and even pivoted to the current business model.

&gt;The original business plan focused on allowing people to transfer money electronically via the Palm hand-held computer. But Musk quickly saw that the ‚Äúkiller‚Äù application would be a system that allowed the secure e-mailing of payments using any type of PC, according to Sacks, the former PayPal COO.

From [David Saks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_O._Sacks) ,  founding COO and product leader of¬†PayPal till sale to ebay, in [Article](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2003-apr-22-fi-spacex22-story.html)

By the time he was replaced with Thiel , the business model was already figured out , the company had already scaled and was one of the largest payment providers. Neither the business model nor the end product saw major changes over that period.

&gt;not his orginal idea

Yes , confinity had a product called PayPal , but the idea isn't the main thing. There were also many well funded competitors already, such as Citigroup with their c2it email payment service, BancOne's emoneymail, Yahoo's PayDirect, Western Union's BidPay, etc. Even X had a email payment service. What mattered was turning it into the market leader and a money making one at that, which included

* Solving PayPal's problem of losing money because people would instantly take out the money to their bank account after transfers. The key to making it a success was incentivising people to keep their money there by offering bank like services. Paypal started offering things like money market fund and debit card , borrowed over from X which managed to do just that.

Elon wanted to commercialize [a prototype called the T-Zero by AC Propulsion.](https://i.imgur.com/nPj6twT.png) As he didn't have the time to run both spacex and the new company , the AC zero guys sent him to another team looking to commercialize it.

&gt;AC Propulsion developed the idea, and both Eberhard and Musk initially approached the San Dimas, California, company to build the car. 

&gt;Both Eberhard and Musk saw the importance ‚Äì and potential ‚Äì of what Gage and Cocconi had created. When Eberhard and Musk approached them individually to prod them into taking the next step and produce the vehicle, Gage opted instead to introduce Musk to Eberhard and get back to work creating¬†the eBox, an electrified Scion xB that Gage considered more practical and economical.

[Source](https://www.wired.com/2009/06/tesla-founder/)

When Musk approached Martin , the business consisted of nothing but an unfunded business plan to commercialize the T-Zero. While there was a basic corporation in place, Tesla hadn‚Äôt even registered or obtained the trademark to its name and had no formal offices or assets.

To save legal fees, they even copied the SpaceX articles of incorporation and bylaws for Tesla. Even the Tesla logo was designed by RO Studio, same guys Musk had hired to design the SpaceX logo.

Again from previous wired article article

&gt;And Musk didn't act sooner to replace Eberhard, either in the early days when one member of the management team sought his ouster or at the series C round of funding when a top-tier venture capitalist conditioned an investment offer on Eberhard's departure (In both cases, Musk backed Eberhard). Both men have privately, and sometimes publicly, regretted those decisions.

Elon supported Martin even though others protested that he wasn't running the company properly. When it came to light he was lying about the costs of the roadster , Musk ousted reluctantly replaced him, running both companies and pouring every bit of money he had into it, saving it.

Later Martin sued to make the first two sole founders , while Elon wanted all of the early team ( including JB , who joined after him , and he himself bought on ) as co-founders.

[Judge strikes down request that former CEO Martin Eberhard be declared one of only two founders of the automotive start-up.](https://www.cnet.com/news/teslas-musk-gloats-over-eberhard-ruling/)

&gt; A San Mateo County Superior Court judge on Wednesday denied former Tesla Motors CEO Martin Eberhard's request that he be declared one of only two Tesla founders, according to a statement released by Tesla Motors late Wednesday night.

&gt; The ruling is in keeping with¬†Tesla's claim that the company was founded by a team of several people, including Musk, rather than just two men.",elonmusk

"**On SpaceX**

&gt;He does do technical work. He is intimately involved in the design process, though I doubt that includes making 3D CAD designs of individual parts, programming flight software, or anything like that.

\- Reliability Analysis Engineer at SpaceX

&gt;Elon is both the Chief Executive Officer and¬†Chief¬†Technology¬†Officer¬†of SpaceX, so of course he does more than just ‚Äòsome¬†very technical work‚Äô. He is integrally involved in the actual design and engineering of the rocket, and at least touches every other aspect of the business (but I would say the former takes up much more of his mental real estate). Elon is an engineer at heart, and that‚Äôs where and how he works best.

\- Former Head of Quality Assurance at SpaceX

Sourced from [here](https://www.quora.com/Does-Elon-Musk-do-some-very-technical-work-code-design-etc-at-SpaceX) . I have gone though LinkedIn and other details online and don't think these people are lying about their positions. Other anecdotes can be found on places like hackernews but without profiles can't be verified.

Also excerpts from [Tom Mueller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Mueller) , Former CTO of Propulsion at SpaceX and main guy behind the Merlin engines, speaking [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/6b043z/_/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacexlounge/comments/hcn6pc/_/) to a very small group of students , where the stream was later removed , but the community saved the transcript.

&gt;We‚Äôll have, you know, a group of people sitting in a room, making a key decision. And everybody in that room will say, you know, basically, ‚ÄúWe need to turn left,‚Äù and Elon will say ‚ÄúNo, we‚Äôre gonna turn right.‚Äù You know, to put it in a metaphor. And that‚Äôs how he thinks. He‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúYou guys are taking the easy way out; we need to take the hard way.‚Äù 

&gt;And, uh, I‚Äôve seen that hurt us before, I‚Äôve seen that fail, but I‚Äôve also seen‚Äî where nobody thought it would work‚Äî it was the right decision. It was the harder way to do it, but in the end, it was the right thing.

&gt;...

&gt;And now we have the lowest-cost, most reliable engines in the world. And it was basically because of that decision, to go to do that. So that‚Äôs one of the examples of Elon just really pushing‚Äî he always says we need to push to the limits of physics.

&gt;Elon is brilliant. He‚Äôs involved in just about everything. He understands everything. If he asks you a question, you learn very quickly not to go give him a gut reaction.

&gt;He wants answers that get down to the fundamental laws of physics. One thing he understands really well is the physics of the rockets. He understands that like nobody else. The stuff I have seen him do in his head is crazy.

&gt;He can get in discussions about flying a satellite and whether we can make the right orbit and deliver Dragon at the same time and solve all these equations in real time. It‚Äôs amazing to watch the amount of knowledge he has accumulated over the years.

"&gt;Saving fuel has nothing do with cost

With traditional launchers the fuel for the upper stages or the exploration stage takes a considerable about of the stupidly expensive payload. If you can reduce the fuel mass, you can increase the actually useful payload, without making the mission even more expensive. Traditional mission profiles to Mars call for several fuel launches on expendable launchers. Obviously you want to minimise the number of fuel launches. If you can cut back even one launch with a flyby at venus, you can easily save 200 millions on your mission, making it more likely to be approved by Congress. 

With Starship nothing of that is a concern.

The density of the an empty starship is 117 kg/cubic meter. So even at the surface it would not be buoyant. Even if we pulled a vacuum inside starship. 

To achieve a liveable temperature of 30-40c it's seems we would need a floating base around 40km high with an atmospheric pressure showing around 2 bar'ish. This zone is a sulphuric acid haze zone. It seems completely plausible to create a craft that would be rigid and buoyant at that altitude.

Yes, AFIS has existed and been used since the 90s. However, that doesn't take less than an hour. The shortest time for all 10 fingerprints is about 2 hours, more realistically it's generally about 5-7hrs. Forget about hours if you only have one, or a partial print, that can take as long as many weeks.

However, even when AFIS turns up a match, that match still needs to be examined by someone for it to be treated as admissible evidence. The state cannot only use an AFIS match, it still needs to be checked, as scars, cuts and multiple other ""mutilations"" can throw off the system completely and before you know it John Smith is Joe Giorgione, not a good look for the ADA, and a field day for the defense.

There‚Äôs an old Chinese proverb that says:‚ÄùGive a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime‚Äù That‚Äôs the biggest difference between Bill Gates and Elon Musk, Bill Gates is buying you fish &amp; chips for a day, Elon Musk teaches you how to fish. Al-tough a more accurate metaphor when it comes to both men‚Äôs philanthropic endeavors would be that Bill Gates is trying to cure cancer by only treating the symptoms whereas Elon Musk ignores the symptoms but try to find the source of the tumors in order to cut it out.

At first glance Bill Gates seems to be a much more generous and influential philanthropist than Elon Musk, Gates Foundation commits $258.3 million to cure malaria in developing countries and provides free Malaria vaccine in India.

Elon Musk on the other hand, makes electric cars and created his own foundation that funds clean energy research and science advocacy (see the amazing ‚Äôs answer for more details on this), which appears to be much less impressive than Bill Gates‚Äôs ‚Äúgood deeds‚Äù, in fact, I can‚Äôt even count how many times I have seen the question:‚ÄùWhy don‚Äôt Elon Musk just donate his money to solve world hunger instead of squandering it to explore Mars?‚Äù posted and retweeted by scientifically illiterate people all over the world, and they couldn‚Äôt be more wrong.

For example, China's polluted air kills 4,400 a day, India‚Äôs Malaria infected mosquitoes kill 2,7 a day, so Elon Musk‚Äôs endeavors(open source electric car patents and clean energy research) has the potential to save 4,400 lives per day in China and will lead to the creation of a lot of jobs, on the other hand, Bill Gates‚Äôs endeavors although commendable will ‚Äúonly‚Äù save 2,7 lives per day in India. So even though Elon Musk is donating less money to charities than Bill Gates, Elon is actually being more philanthropic than Bill Gates.

[About the Aero L-39 Albatros](http://twinandturbine.com/article/l-39-albatros-fly-fighter-jet/)

After Elon Musk made his¬†first millions¬†from the sales of Zip2 and PayPal, he invested much of the money into founding SpaceX in 2002 and co-founding Tesla in 2003. But in addition to launching two of the world's most famous startups, Musk also devoted some cash to his love of aviation.


Musk describes flying it [here](https://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2003/10/06/350397/index.htm)

&gt;Probably the most fun plane I have is a Russian fighter jet. It's called an L-39. It has a Czech air frame, a Ukrainian engine, Russian avionics. It's what they used to train their fighter pilots on, so it's incredibly acrobatic. But your butt hurts if you fly in it for more than an hour. The seats are really hard.

&gt;You can do eight Gs in that plane. You pretty much need a G-suit, or you could black out. I might go up to five, but that's the most. Five Gs means that's five times your body weight. It's pretty hard to move. You feel very heavy. Your cheeks are being sucked down. If you maintain five Gs for too long, it's very hard to concentrate. You start seeing red dots.

&gt;Probably the most fun flight I did was with another L-39 in Nevada. It's kind of open airspace, so we did a tail chase, where we basically followed another plane through the mountains at very low altitude. Literally, it was just like in Top Gun. You're no more than a couple of hundred feet above the ground, following the contour of the mountains. We came up to a mountain, did a vertical climb up the side of it, inverted. Turned upside down. Yeah, that was fun. It's like a roller coaster. Only you go much farther up and down.

Him on stopping , from [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2008/09/24/DI2008092402502.html)

&gt;Sadly, I don't pilot myself any more, but do have a (lapsed) multi-engine IFR rating. I have to work when I fly and have too many thoughts in my head to pay the necessary attention to the plane -- I can be absentminded at times, which is a really bad habit for a pilot.",elonmusk

"Gonna go on a rant here, But I love how much tesla has impacted the automotive industry and the space industry (but I'll talk about that another time)

When tesla stated they were nobody's with a small crappy factory, but when you look at them now they've shaped and changes the electric automotive industry the gigafactory is the largest building in length. 

People kept saying ""you can't make cheap and reliable electric cars with long range they won't work"" 

But just like landing and reusing a rocket, Elon and his team proved them wrong. 

Look at how many automotive companies are now pushing for electric cars, nearly every car company has come out and said that they're making a new electric or electric hybrid car. 

There may have been a few bumps along the way (I'm looking at you roadster and model S production) 

But look at them now. Tesla stock is insane and they're cars are rated some of the most reliable and safest cars in the market for a budget. 

Elon not only helped the company but saved and changed it, but he's not the only one there we can't forget about fanz (the lead designer at tesla)

Tesla are fantastic and their consistent improvements on full self driving and autopilot are basically unheard from other automotive companies (that I'm aware of) not to mention the updates to the software and adding new games and features like Spotify and Netflix. 

Also the app, we can't forget about the app YOU CAN CALL AND SUMMON YOUR CAR TO YOU FROM A MOTHER FUCKING APP, YOU CAN EVEN OPEN YOUR CAR FROM THE APP! No need for a key when YOU ARE THE KEY. I haven't even seen another car company do stuff like that.

&gt;Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues &amp; give up stock options for nothing? Our safety record is 2X better than when plant was UAW &amp; everybody already gets healthcare.

&gt;Exactly. UAW does not have individual stock ownership as part of the compensation at any other company.

And to put some source behind what he said in the tweet

Same plant under GM/Toyota under the same UAW , before Tesla took over 

&gt;Under Toyota and GM leadership, the factory had an average recordable incident rate of 12.6 between 2003 and 2009, and in each of these years, the numbers were worse than the industry average. However, Tesla recorded a rate of just 6.2 last year.¬†

Gen X basically made British punk rock a trend so its not a surprise Coupland used a British band name.

No no Gen X is a cohort of individuals who grow up in the environment specific to the United States between 1964-5 &amp; 1979-1980

&gt;""Speculation over the name X √Ü A-12 has been a major topic of conversation since the couple welcomed the baby boy into the world on Monday, with questions over what the characters mean.

Later in that article:

"Form roughly equals American Grade, but the numbering system is different. Think of Form 1 as Grade 6.

O-Level = Ordinary Level. Examination at 16years old. Roughly equivalent to High School Diploma, except you are graded on each individual subject, not just given a overall passing grade. For many, it‚Äôs the end of formal schooling and they enter the workforce.

A-Level = Advanced Level. Examination at 18 years old. Roughly equivalent to end of 1st year of College in the US.

After this is University (US College), with a 4 year degree course ending in a BA or BSc. Then Masters and PhD degrees, like in the US.",elonmusk

My personal dislike of Elon comes largely from the Bolivia incident and his response to it and (and this is the main thing) his use of the cobalt mines in the DRC. I can forgive his other wrongdoings as I will attribute them to his inexperience in certain fields, not saying that all leftists will feel the same.

I watched the video and I think there is validity to applying this argument across the political spectrum. There is no Marxist apocolypse or Conservative plague. There are opinions and positions. The best anyone can do is reference as many sources as possible and take in the information yourself. To truly do this, you must be vulnerable, because sometimes the truth really hurts... and it's often difficult to accept that your opinion can change, that something you have held for so long may be false.

 20 million people die of easily preventable deaths annually because they do not have the resources to save themselves. To put it into perspective, given the holocaust took four years, that's about 7.2 holocausts every year. Elon Musk could use his wealth to save literally millions of lives without even affecting his own lifestyle. He is so wealthy, he could give away dozens of billions of dollars,  perhaps just stop one of those seven holocausts happening annually, and his life wouldn't change at all.

"It's a necessity in this system. I'm talking money profit.

Imagine that in some remote place on Earth, a large population suddenly loses all their food production and without outside help, would starve. If the costs of taking the food there are greater than what the locals could spend buying it, nobody would give them the help they need. That's awful, and shouldn't happen in any good system.

Now guess what, it happens in every country. Lots of people starve because there isn't enough profit to be made selling them food. Even though enough food is produced, and a lot of it ends up in the trash.",elonmusk
"I think you're grasping at straws at this point. 

While it's true he's one of the richest people in the world now, one cannot just give out billions and still maintain a controlling stock in his companies. You'd think it would be ""evil"" not to maintain a certain % to keep control of his companies but if you think about how he was booted from paypal, then you'd know surviving in a corporate world is vastly different from surviving in say.... school or something.


To say that he can save millions of lives without affecting his own lifestyle (implying that he hasn't) is also offputting in a way. It's very possible to donate secretly btw, and he has done that.

Except I'm not. There is  currently no good example of successful communist states /countries where people enjoy the same or greater freedom than capitalist countries.

"Further proof that trickle down economics don‚Äôt work considering that people are experiencing the worst economic hardships in a century right now but all of the mega-rich continue to get richer without having to work on it because they‚Äôve reached the critical mass of wealth where they‚Äôd have to actively try to lose money in order to stop getting richer.

"&gt;No no, the ‚Äúideal‚Äù life according to these numbskulls is to still be poor as f* and spread the wealth around. You know what‚Äôs eerily similar to that? communism.

You are also mistaking communism as a concept of wealth redistribution (Socialism, like healthcare and education etc) and ""communism"" 

Communism can be the failed attempts where it never actually happened and was more of a fascist dictatorship, or the never realized concept like you mentioned. Just saying ""Communism bad"" is pretty silly because it has never happened. Either way that is not what I am trying to talk about.

What has actually happened is these ""numbskulls"" you are talking about wanting wealth redistribution (better word is socialism). Also known as taxes, benefiting society. So when a mega billionaire like Bezos makes a shit ton of money and pays barely any taxes for his corporation and treats employees like shit, people want some wealth redistribution. 

He has taken advantage of the system to the point where many others suffer and doesn't benefit the system by paying back into it. I don't know Musk's effects in these ways, and I admire what he has done, but wanting wealth redistribution is still fine.",elonmusk

"BokuWaKamida explained it well. Only thing i will add is this: the theoretical Instagram posts that say if Bezos and Musk and Gates all put their money together it would solve world hunger is completely false. The western world is built upon its own giants of commerce. When people‚Äôs wealth is stored in shares, that means they must sell them to access the cash. If Bezos sold more than 5% of Amazon at once or in the same quarter, the Amazon price would be effected. ‚ÄúWhy is Bezos selling off? Should i also?..‚Äù it‚Äôs possible Bezos selling his shares and taking, example, 1 billion dollars out, the share price impact from doing that could result in him losing 5% of every share, which would be a fuckton more than 1 billion worth of $. Net worth from shares held is misleading because it‚Äôs trapped. In Elon‚Äôs case, he LITERALLY cannot sell for at least 5 years in his Chairman contract, allowing the price to maintain stability.",elonmusk

"(Ignore grammar mistakes, I'm german as you can imagine) 

T√ºbingen is a city in Baden W√ºrttemberg (Germany) and my hometown. It's not a huge but also not a small city. T√ºbingen is famous for it's university, many students and science. 

The vaccine manufacturer CureVac has its headquarters here. Tesla cooperates with CureVac and Elon visited them to see a new 3D printing technology, which could speed up the production of a Corona vaccination. 

MONDAY:
When I read that Elon would visit T√ºbingen, I was over the moon. Elon is my idol and an inspiration for me, I'm following his work for years now. That Elon Musk would come into my city was just surreal. 
Sadly I was on vacation, I knew I wouldn't have the chance to see him. I thought: ""If I can't see him, my friends should."" so I told all my friends in T√ºbingen that Elon would come. They are also fans and were really excited too. 

In the beginning it wasn't even clear, if Elon would come directly to T√ºbingen but then CureVacs press officer confirmed it. 
Elon would arrive on Tuesday at a unknown time at the CureVac HQ but he didn't want press. It would be ""undercover‚Äú.
Knowing he would definitely come, we read news articles and searched through social media. We wanted to calculate the rough time when we could see him, arriving at CureVac. We had a battle plan! ‚Üì
1. Wait in front of the CureVac building for Elon to arrive
2. Take a look at him when he goes into it.
3. Maybe ask him for photo. (A photo with Elon Musk is our biggest dream.) 

TUESDAY MORNING:
At 7 AM, 3 of my friends went to the CureVac building. Then they prepared them self to wait. 
With time more fans joined them. Some Teslas, driven by enthusiastic fans, parked on the parking lot. 
After a few hours CureVac had to order security to the building, because they were so many fans waiting. 
You have to know that the whole thing was a big event for us locals. Reporters were also waiting and there even was a live feed with the latest news. 

TUESDAY 4 PM: 
After 8 hours of waiting in heavy rainfall a Model X showed up at the end of the street. 
In it, on the passenger seat, was Elon. 
The car drove immediately in the underground car park, Elon didn't even greeted the fans. The local reporters shot some pictures.
Some fans (among them my friends) were dispirited and sad because they only saw Elon for a few seconds through the car window, they left. Others didn't give up and luckily stayed.


TUESDAY 8 PM:
After hours of meetings Elon came out of the building. He was surrounded by CureVac employees and bodyguards and had a black bandana wrapped around his face.  
He walked across the field in front of the CureVac building to bath in the crowd of the (around 50) fans, who waited. 
As far as I know everybody kept distance and he only exchanged a couple of words with a few people. Many fans made selfies from a distance. 
There was a engineering student, who had a sign with the words ""I WANT TO WORK FOR YOU!"". He showed Elon a self-built fully electric motorcycle. Elon was very interested and they talked a for a while. 

After 15 minutes of interaction with fans and reporters Elon left to drive to the airport.",elonmusk

"&gt; Everything he's ever done is a new product. 

No. Maybe, arguably, a few things he's ""done"" were actually new. But not everything. Neuralink for example is nothing new. The current state of art is way ahead of what Neuralink is hoping to achieve. They have been a lot of commentaries by neuroscientists recently on this.

&gt; Electric vehicles were pathetic.  

Implicitly, you admit that electric vehicles existed before. They were not good enough for your taste. Whatever you mean by pathetic. The best thing you can say is that Tesla is about to have success in offering attractive electric vehicles. Nothing new. Just better.

&gt;   Space flight was massively expensive and ruled by government agencies. 

Again you admit that he did not invent Space Flight. He just participated in making it cheaper and more efficient, as a businessman. Here I have to admit that his role is indeed innovatory. 

All of this is still not enough to make him the leading innovator in the world. SpaceX might be his only innovation.",elonmusk

"I'm arguing against the point you did take. I just applied it rhetorically to ""any issue you could ask about"" to illustrate what a ridiculous assumption it was that you made. It would be equally ridiculous to say ""well I'm sure they thought that"" as an answer to ANY engineering question, that was my point. It's a thought terminating non answer that detracts from the discussion of people actual trying to talk about the engineering problems 

&gt; And that false claim I made doesn't diminish my point in any way, it was tangential. Also, I forgot. I knew that, but forgot. That happens. Still, doesn't impact my argument.

It really does impact your argument and diminish your point, entirely. Why else would you delete it? Your only comment that said anything substantive or falsifiable, and you erase it after its easily proven false. When your whole initial point was ""I am willing to bet they thought of it"" and people ask why, and you give the reasons... 

That's not a tangent. That's called supporting your point with evidence. And when your evidence failed for being factually wrong, you deleted it and said ""ahh it was just an irrelevant tangent""

&gt; you really think they didn't have someone think ""what if something breaks down inside the tunnel?""

This is an appeal to incredulity. It doesn't matter how dumb you make it sound, people make mistakes all the time, and its valid to discuss that possibility. The burden of proof is on you, my dude.

"This money isn't as useful to most people as they think it is.

Suppose you take all this essentially dead (not circulating) money and redistribute it.

Now it circulates and velocity of money increases, so inflation increases proportionally. No additional goods or real wealth will be produced by redistributing this money. People see it as some kind of virtual panacea, yet it is but a mirage. Real wealth in a nation is not its currency, but rather the goods and services produced by its collective citizens.

And the greatest irony? Those that are the biggest proponents of taxation to solve this inequality problem are usually the same people that are okay with deficit spending and money creation that led to this situation in the first place. Almost all new money created is ending up at the top. When beloved liberal governments around the world print money like mad, they do so full well knowing it will all end up at the top.

Most of the constituents are farmers who take care of their own heating. Traditionally it means truckloads of coal shipped to the villages late autumn.

The idea is to slowly move from coal to biogas, but they can be stubborn.

Lots and lots of small or medium coal mines went out of business. My cousin's office received death threats, mob attacks, assassination attempts on one of the investigation teams from the province, bribery, at one point their office building was blocked by 4 tons of cow shit. 

Eventually they stopped, presumably because they are out of business and/or Cow poo. And the few left over started rumours saying clean coal is ""less hot"" or ""poisonous"".

"You are completely wrong. Einstein's explanation has been completely verified experimentally by Robert Millikan who spent ten years trying to disprove the Law of the photoelectric effect. He confirmed Einstein's theory in **EVERY DETAIL**   He did publish his results although he was unhappy about them. Your pathetic attempt is pure nonsense.

 A photon does not exist and cannot be detected? I suggest you read up on the Compton effect which absolutely proves that it does. 
 Over and over again Einstein's work has been verified experimentally.
 The photon anti-bunching effect is another experiment that shows photons exist. These three things kick your claim of no such thing as a photon right in the balls. I can just see you bent over clutching your crotch right now.

BTW Einstein dealt with the emission of electrons and he was responsible for classification of the duality of light waves and particles (photons) which no one had done before. It was his insight of light as particles that led to a major contribution in quantum mechanics. 

 &gt;I will not find a single highly regarded physicist that claims photons are real. 

How about Einstein himself? Or https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03280 (Hope you have a subscription.) He is more highly acclaimed than anyone you can cite to the contrary. 

https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Challenge-Second-Foundations-Mechanics/dp/076372470X/ Here is some *light* reading about the reality of photons.

Classical theory cannot explain the six experimental results found in the area of research.  Only one of them.  Einstein's theory does explain them all.. 


The number of electrons emitted increases as you increase the intensity of the light. (Higher intensity means more total energy, which means more photons. More photons means more electrons knocked loose.)

The energy of the electrons emitted does not depend on the intensity at all. (The electron energy is whatever's left of a single photon energy after you supply the energy needed for the work function. The total number of photons has nothing to do with it.)

As you vary the frequency of the light, you find that there is a frequency below which no electrons are emitted, no matter how high an intensity you use. (If the photon energy is less than the energy required to free an electron, it doesn't matter how many photons you throw at the system, nothing's going to happen.)

Above the cutoff frequency, the energy of the electrons emitted increases linearly as you increase the frequency. (The higher the frequency, the higher the photon energy, and the higher the photon energy, the more energy is left for the electron.)

There's no time delay. No matter how low you make the intensity, if electrons are emitted at all, they come out instantly. (One photon is all it takes. You don't need to build up energy slowly.)

If you keep a constant intensity, and vary the frequency, you find fewer electrons coming out at higher frequencies. (Intensity is a measure of the total energy in the beam. If you increase the frequency, you increase the energy per photon, and thus need fewer photons to make up the same total energy. Fewer photons means fewer electrons.)

"Not just America but the new world in general. It's so easy to blame America but a lot of other places need to take responsibility too. We in Canada are really bad for this too.

The entirety of Western Canada is essentially a car only economy. Passenger train lines exist, but serve only tourist circuits in the west, and have to give scheduling priority to freight trains. (The one time I've ridden a western Canadian train, a trip scheduled for 22 hours become 42 because of freight train delays. Obviously this is not a practical option for anyone engaging in anything but leisure tourism)

 In my particular province, Saskatchewan, (which is very small, but still relevant) we have literally ZERO bus outside of cities. Our government defunded our already small public bus service, and this caused Greyhound (private contractor) to also completely withdraw from our market. This is in a place where it is possible to die of exposure (freeze to death) during 6 months of the year. It's essentially neo-feudalism. People without cars are literally welded to the land.

But what about planes? Well ignoring the economic cost (low cost carriers dont exist here really, Regina &gt; Calgary is the shortest route I'd feasibly fly and I dont think it ever goes below 400$) at least one of our two airports is totally inaccessible by foot: there is not even a city bus line going there. What are your options if you're just a normal person from some shitty circumstances who wants to get out of this repressive backwater? Literally selling yourself or hitchhiking (selling yourself with extra steps). 

I know I'm getting off track here, but Freedom of Movement within national borders is a UN mandated human rite. Not only are Western governments ignoring and imposing on that right: doing so actively worsens the climate crisis. It's a lose/lose game. A huge part of the problem in Canada and America is the false equivalence that ""car = freedom"" which is a message encouraged and pushed by governments and oil lobbies.

What makes this even worse: Western Canadian cars are actually specially modified with block heaters, and most people drive pick up trucks. It gets so cold here that in the winter people need to start their car 10-15 minutes in advance of driving for the engine to be able to run. A natural consequence of this is that it's also common for people to leave their car running for fairly long periods of time in the winter when they go into the store/are running errands etc. So not only do we use our cars more than (probably) anywhere else in the world, we also drive some of the worst vehicles and have some of the worst practices in terms of pollution.",Futurology

Plastics are really long chains, so to get them to the right length usually ends up with a lot more smaller pieces, and sticking things back together really isn't feasible in terms of cost.

As a surveillance measure they MIGHT be useful around urban or high traffic wilderness areas, but that introduces all sorts of safety, privacy and noise issues. 

Its possibly in the future if we developed better solar tech, better cameras, autonomous drone software and an AI to link and control hundreds of drones, this kind of thing could actually be done.

"Thanks for the response. Here are some thoughts as I read through:
&gt;Climate change causes forest fuels (the organic matter that burns and spreads wildfire) to be more dry, and has doubled the number of large fires between 1984 and 2015 in the western United States.

This is blatantly poorly stated. The climate did not warm up enough to ignite anything. This should be stated as ""climate change made fire that have started be more difficult to contain and put out."" But the climate did not ignite anything. 1st paragraph.

Paragraph 2 clarified this, but logical readers would have turned off based on the lie in paragraph one. 

Later on in the article, it states that 2017 was abonormally bad, but that was also when california didn't do very much controlled burn. Those may be related, but I think the reason they didn't do controlled burn could be the uncontrolled burning happening. I would have to look at a calendar and a timeline to determine that. I mentioned the lack of burns in a different reply.

It mentions monetary damage, but that isn't a really good metric (note, it isn't a bad one, but it is easily distorted when talking climate change). Once you set a 100 story building on fire, the dollar value is taken as gospel, as in 1 acre you took out a billion dollar building, but that is irrelevant to climate change when you are referring to dry soil and things like that. granted, wind can help spread, but again, I think that stat goes back to and better with acreage.

The recommendations at the bottom of the article are worth discussion though:
&gt;Communities, builders, homeowners, and forest managers can reduce the likelihood and impacts of wildfires by:
&gt;Discouraging developments (especially residential) near fire-prone forests through smart zoning rules.
This seems smart. Don't build in high wind plane areas without natural water access.

&gt;Increasing the space between structures and nearby trees and brush, and clearing space between neighboring houses.
Encourages sprawl, which makes things worse?

&gt;Incorporating fire-resistant design features and materials in buildings.
Mandated by building code for a long... long... time (I am in construction)

&gt;Increasing resources allocated to firefighting and fire prevention.
Funding is always good.

&gt;Removing fuels, such as dead trees, from forests that are at risk.
This seems to be much more important. Removing the fuel stops the fire. Based on a previous reply, I think California is failing here.

&gt;Developing recovery plans before a fire hits, and implementing plans quickly after a fire to reduce erosion, limit flooding, and minimize habitat damage.
Good planning always helps.

Gasoline cars were originally completely mechanical devices, and with advent of electrical computers became more efficient and powerfull.
Press the gas pedal more, more fuel injected that makes it go faster, and mechanically linked valve timing follows directly.

Has big oil stiffled development after WW2? possible. For aviation however it is simply the case that kerosine had incredible power density, and there even today no practical substitute exists.

Seems to be saying if your heart rate is always 'up' even when sleeping that shows a correlation with depression.



If you're depressed it's hard to sleep and when you do sleep your dreams would likely relate to all the issues making you depressed which could dump some adrenaline while sleeping leading to less restful sleep which would make depression even more likely.

"Sadly there do not appear to be any summary sources (at least that showed up in a quick Google). You can read about the controversy surrounding Zenn to get some background. Then after that it's just catching scams as they pop up, over and over.

There are, for instance,  kickstarter pages constantly popping up, but most of them get taken down as scams by the crowdfunding companies, so they leave no lasting impression on the internet. There are webpages for these ultracap scams popping in and out of existence all the time, but unless they happen to get archived by a third party they also leave no lasting impression online. Easy come, easy go.

The best thing you can do on short notice is, I suppose, to read up about the differences between capacitors (of all types) and batteries, and why they're different. Wikipedia gives a good summary on them, and the listed sources at the bottom of the page make for good further reading. I'll do a short summary for you below to lay out the basics of why these types of scams are just as impossible as a free energy scam.
____
Basically, capacitors (*especially* ultracaps) have an exceptionally high power density, but an exceptionally low energy density the (I'll explain the difference in a moment). Batteries are the opposite, though modern lithium ion designs have an impressive (though still quite modest) power density to go along with their high energy density.

Power density is (basically) the speed at which you can charge and discharge an energy storage device. Energy density is the amount of energy it can store per unit of mass or volume. So power is speed, energy is amount. Capacitors are fast, batteries store a lot. Batteries are slow, capacitors store little.

Power density and energy density are (roughly, more or less) inversely proportional. As you increase one you decrease the other. You may be able to eventually very careful design a battery with a few times greater power density than current batteries, but there is a practical limit. You may be able to eventually design an ultracapacitor with a few times higher energy density, but the starting point of modern ultracaps is so low that that wouldn't really get you anywhere useful (at least not for mass storage).

As a rough, somewhat inaccurate analogy, imagine two tubs of water. One is very shallow, the other is very deep. You can fill the shallow one up very quickly, but you can't store much in it. You can store a lot in the deep one, but it can't be filled very quickly specifically because it is so deep. You can make the shallow one wider and wider to store more water, but eventually it grows to the size that it's cumbersome to use. You can make it much deeper instead, but then you're taking away the very thing that made it quick to fill compared to the deep tub: its shallowness.

Similarly, if you increase the energy density of an ultracapacitor enough to make it useful for large-scale energy storage, and you've kept its ""shallowness"" so that it's quick to fill, it's now obnoxiously large. Look at a Tesla grid storage megapack, then imagine it thousands of times bigger.

The other choice is to keep the size small but then sacrifice power density until the energy density gets up to an acceptable level. Congratulations, you've just invented the battery! At this point you've just created a much shittier, more expensive type of battery than a lithium ion battery - worse even than an old-school lead-acid battery.
____
That's the basic conundrum. Ultracapacitors are fast but shallow, batteries are deep but slow. You can use little design tricks to make each a bit better - in our water tub analogy you could taper the edges, for instance - but fundamentally the two technologies are good for opposite applications. 

Batteries work well for grid storage because you don't need massive amounts of power (but small amounts of energy) delivered or stored in a fraction of a second, instead you need a lot of energy stored over a long period of time (hours or days), then dribbled out to the grid as required.",Futurology
"Ideally industry will transition to hydrogen, leaving natural gas in the domestic space.

https://xkcd.com/605/

Read this.

This is what you're doing when you say things like this:

&gt; You were aware that the 2019/2020 Australian wildfires approximately doubled their CO2 emissions over the last year?

Year to year wildfire sizes fluctuate considerably.

For example, in the United States, in 2012, over 9 million acres were burned. In 2013, less than 4 million acres were burned. In 2014, that was down to just over 3 million acres burned.

According to your ""logic"", the size of wildfires in the US had decreased by over 60% in two years!

But in reality, this is fluctuation. 2015 saw 10 million acres of land burned.

There is an upward trend, but trying to use year to year data like this is completly wrong and no one with even the most basic level of background in statistics would do it.

The fact that you're making this error means that you don't really understand how to deal with data like this at all, and you should probably severely ramp down your confidence in your beliefs.

You can [manipulate](https://wildfiretoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Acres-burned-wildfire-US.jpg) the [trendline](https://wildfiretoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Acres-all-50-states-1986-2012.jpg) by arbitrarily picking different start and end dates.

&gt; One factor in the recent fires is almost certainly inadequate forest management, but it is far from the only factor.

I didn't say it was the only factor. I said it was a large factor.

It is a larger factor than global warming is.

But global warming is a factor as well.

Year to year fluctuations are caused by variations in climactic conditions.

&gt; Of the estimated eight million species on Earth, a million are now threatened with extinction, one expert warns.

These numbers are entirely made up.

There are 41,415 species on the IUCN redlist, of which 16,306 of them are endangered species threatened with extinction

https://www.endangeredearth.com/#:~:text=THE%20PLIGHT%20OF%20ENDANGERED%20SPECIES%3A,endangered%20animals%20and%20endangered%20plants.

People constantly fabricate numbers like these which have zero scientific basis.

&gt; Since 1970, vertebrate animals - birds, mammals, reptiles, fish and amphibians - have declined by 60%, another tells us.

This is also fabricated. I literally pointed this out elsewhere in the thread.

https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2018/11/animal-decline-living-planet-report-conservation-news/

It's an example of abuse of statistics.

That's not to say that the number of wild animals is not in decline - it is - but the number you're citing is flat-out false. It isn't what the number means.

As explained in the article:

&gt; Let‚Äôs say for example you have 50 tigers, 200 falcons, and 10,000 squirrels. Let‚Äôs say the first population declines by 90 percent, to 5 tigers. The second declines 80 percent, to 40 falcons. And the squirrels drop to 9,000‚Äîa 10 percent fall. That‚Äôs a 60 percent average decline of these three fictitious populations, but only a total decline of 12 percent of the individuals.

Again, you don't understand this stuff at all.

&gt; You seem stuck in an anti-malthusian mindset. A view that where, just because something has never happened before, then it can't possibly ever happen.

You are indistinguishable from the followers of Harold Camping.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Camping

Repeated failed prophecies, repeated scrambling to try and find another date for the apocaylpse and a new justification for it.

Repeated failure.

But you don't abandon it, because your belief in the apocalypse was never based on logic, it is based purely on faith.

This is why you're getting so upset at me - because I'm challenging your core belief in an upcoming apocalypse.

You need to accept that you've been indoctrinated into an apocalyptic cult, and get out of it.

The entire idea of a Malthusian catastrophe is completely false. It's not how reality works.

Here's how science works: you make a prediction, and you test it.

If your hypothesis repeatedly fails, it means you're wrong, and you need to abandon it.

This is precisely what has happened.

In real life, per capita agricultural productivity has been going up steadily because of improvements in technology.

Which is exactly what scientists predicted.

&gt; So we keep using fossil fuels? You might have missed the whole, IPCC project this path puts us on a 3C+ warming track. That is widely regarded as incompatible with organised human civilisation.

Nope. Only the cult members believe that global warming will end civilization.

There's no scientific basis for that belief whatsoever.

Indeed, the entire idea is *obviously* delusional.

Seriously. THINK.

Humans live in regions that differ by far more than 3 degrees centigrade in average annual temperature *right now*.

In fact, humans live in regions that differ by more than *20 degrees centigrade* in average annual temperature. People live in places like Anchorage, Alaska and Phoenix, Arizona.

The idea that three degrees centigrade of difference will cause global civilization to collapse is completely irrational.

It's not grounded in logic or reason, let alone science.

It's just delusion, pure and simple.

I would never attest that the republicans are pro science.

Now, it only works as long as the temperatures are within the the temperature range the refrigeration gas can operate at, but if it is we can move heat rather than create it. 

Take that example of yours, when moving heat from inside to outside the AC would pump gas from the interior pipes to the exterior pipes. This lowers the pressure of the interior refrigeration gas pipes and cools the gas in the interior pipes which in turn cools the room. In the exterior pipes on the other hand, the pressure rises and, by the ideal gas law, so does the heat and the pipes that heating up the outside.

"Average incomes declined because the post war boom we had ended. After world war two europe was in ruins, and asia was barely developed. In the years right after the war the US alone accounted for fifty percent of global gdp. Fifty percent! Today we account for 15%. 

So that allowed us to build a massive middle class. The lower population helped too, because land was less desirable. That's why boomers could buy houses and put their kids through college on a factory workers pay. 

Trickle down is not and never was an actual economic theory espoused by any economist or even reagan himself. Seriously. Go try and find any economist using that term non pejoratively. You won't because no one did. 

&gt; The US stopped taxing the rich and corporations, so now the middle class or below gets to pay all the taxes.

That is not even close to being true. The top twenty percent of income earners in this country pay 87% of all federal income taxes. You want to take a guess what percentage the bottom fifty percent pay? 

&gt; Productivity, meanwhile, has gone up at least 6 times since then

Right. But increased productivity means fewer jobs almost by definition. Automation, offshoring manafacturing, and massive influxes of low skilled immigrants both legal and illegal was the final nail in the coffin.

Costs for technology have gone down by many orders of magnitude. Computers used to be $10,000. In fact, most consumer goods are much, much cheaper now thanks largely to offshoring manafacturing, and just in time supply chains. 

Now the middle class is growing in the developing world while its shrinking here. You could argue BECAUSE it's shrinking here.

"The Cutty Shark needed that many in total, the titanic had just that many for the boilers.  That doesn't include all the remaining staff.  913 people were needed on the titanic.  

If you are talking about total crew to make the ship sea worthy that's just enough to run the sails and maintain nthe ships basic integrity.  Maybe less than 20.  A ship of the line used anywhere from 150 to 250 sailors to keep the ship running but could function on fewer. They sat at around 2000 lbs as well for comparison.  

What blows those numbers up is the support staff for either passengers or other ship functions.

Agree that it needs to be compared to similiar sized car haulers.  I'm seeing people throwing around numbers for fuel costs that compare this to a neopanamax, when that ship carries way more cargo, and different cargo.

"Because every modern nuclear reactor build in the USA and Europe has been a project management disaster, costing many billions extra and missing schedule by years - without any significant public opposition. We don't have 10 years to wait. Wind and solar buildouts take months once approvals and contracts are in place.

That's if the reactor even gets built - half the USA build attempts were cancelled after wasting billions.

In addition, the scale in terms of GW per year is just tiny compared to wind and solar.  I believe this year Texas (ERCOT) has already built as much wind + solar GW so far in 2020 as all current nuclear builds for the whole USA (whenever they actually get completed)",Futurology

Apparently it's cheaper to make it all the same, but limit some cars so more people have access to it and sell more.

The company can offer free updates, and people can judge a company for selling software locked tiers of performance. They are mutually exclusive. The 'correct' solution would be to 'average' the prices of all the tesla software features and change the minimum price of a tesla vehicle to incorporate that. Do customers want the freedom of a cheaper Tesla by not paying for features they don't want? Or would they rather everyone be forced to pay for features they may not need so that those that want the feature can pay less? This also could help people enjoy features they wouldn't have paid for otherwise, who may then end up enjoying the car even more.

"It's really just a cash grab.  I think Tesla is one of the boldest about it but they're not alone.  Some examples. Jaguar has a V8 engine that it uses across many models.  It can be found in multiple power levels between 495 and 575 hp.  Even within the same model.  There is nothing mechanically different about these engines and the aftermarket can tune them all to the 575 level without issue.  Also many of the German manufacturers follow the ""Gentlemens agreement"" and limit their cars top speed to 155 or 174 mph.  These limits often go away when you buy the ""performance package"".",Futurology

"There have been instances of people who were blinded as children recovering sight as adults. They are still effectively blind in many ways because their brain cannot process visual information. They have difficulty recognizing familiar people and objects. Being able to visually scan and then explore your environment, for example, is necessary to form depth perception, which is just one component of vision. If you're unable to do that during formative years, then, yes, you will lose the ability to do so later on. If you put a child in a dark room alone during their formative years, you will effectively blind them even if nothing was originally wrong with their eyes or brain. If you dont use it during development, you lose it.

What ultimately happens is that the person has vision but the brain can't process it. We see this in children with cortical visual impairments (vision loss resulting from an issue with the brain, not an issue with the eyes itself). You really have a small portion of time to build the neurons that enable meaningful sight, which is why we do so many interventions just to get them to intentionally gaze at a target. This gets much more difficult as the individual gets older and their brain is less able to form the connections needed.

But from 1987-2016, displacement was 16 percent, while reinstatement was just 10 percent. In short, those factory positions or phone-answering jobs are not coming back.

First of all, why are they only looking at industries adopting automation? Why wouldn‚Äôt new jobs in industries not adoption automation matter at all? 

Second, it doesn‚Äôt seem clear how they accounted for changes due to international economic growth.

The US isn‚Äôt the only extremely productive country in the world anymore, Americans are competing against billions of people for work these days.

For wind-mills the environmental damage is know as they produce an astounding 36 tonnes of hazardous fiber-glass waste every 10 to 12 years because the blade-assemblies wear-out on-top-of their egregious land use. The notion of putting them in the water is an *even worse* idea as 11/12^th of the shallow ocean habitat has already been destroyed.  
  
A roll-out of solar and/or wind to furfill baseload and peak would be an environmental catastrophe destroying more of what little habitat remains. Solar and wind **ARE NOT SOLUTIONS**. They cause more damage.  
  
The best course of action is nuclear for baseload and natural-gas for peak. Natural-gas burns 4x clearner than oil or coal - that is a **massive** improvement. The thorium decay chain is preferred but failing that then uranium it is. This needs to hold us over until fusion-power is commercialized.

This wouldn't have been an issue except many of these companies still have yet to pay back their debt, therefore the cost is saddled by the consumer.Historically speaking, when the masses are not only denied access to owning property, but also burdened with the debts of the wealthy, it never ends well.

I would suggest that rather than petulantly spouting about entitlement and adaptation, you ask yourself what the economic reasoning is for the current market and what can be done about it.",Futurology

"That's an absolute straw man of an argument. No one is advocating lower housing costs because it is fair and they have a right. What they are advocating for is that housing costs reflect market values and aren't dictated by forces with zero oversight or limitations. Keep in mind how bad it is for the economy to have a stifled housing market. For one, we have foreign investors who literally just buy up property and let it sit because it is a way to keep equity and wealth out of the hands of their respective governments (looking at you China.) When that happens the house becomes dead weight on the economy because there is no flow of capital apart from property taxes. It would be an entirely different argument if they were rental properties but they are not. That is just one problem, the other is when you have massive rental corporations buying up entire tracts of housing for the sake of a monopoly. In a free market if you were renting from someone and they exorbitantly hiked up your rental prices, you could give them the finger and find a better deal. But when that company owns every home in the area, there is no competition and they have created a monopolistic feedback loop allowing them to charge whatever they want because there is no alternative.

You keep saying that it lies solely with personal responsibility when it doesn't. Yes people can be smarter with their money, but that doesn't excuse the obvious manipulation of the market. Make no mistake, if this continues it will lead to another housing collapse and everyone will suffer because of it.",Futurology

CCAS plants are by definition more appropriate to match with traditionally carbon heavy energy sources, not so much renewable only grids.

The researchers thus conclude that 'Power to Methane' is indeed a promising research direction for certain geographical sweet spots in the world where there are many CO2emissions (near large scale industry for example, called point sources), together with the production of¬†[renewable electricity](https://phys.org/tags/renewable+electricity/).

"I disagree with both of those points.

I wasn't talking about Chem batteries. And if i was Chem batteries will continually improve. People are continuously researching different ways of storing energy. It will always be a good item to research and fund so it probably isn't going away either. 

The big difference here is the design of the grid. It doesn't have to be any more dangerous than it is now. People do it all the time.

If the grid fails, you have no power. That is the situation right now and that is pretty archaic. At this point in tech, it is cheap and easy to implement alternative energy to your own house.

Why do we use AC in our house? Because it is easier to move electricity long distances in this form. Not because it is best for the citizen. Big companies are not going to make decisions that are best for the citizen. They were raking it in with coal. That is why we are having such difficulty moving out of it. They accumulate too much wealth and lobbying power.

"My Reasons to not use nuclear.


1. The damage they can cause if they are not maintained overtime eg: budget cuts

2. Target for terrorists attacks or bombing ( eg: poor nations where defense of these structures may not be guaranteed over 50 years )

3. Nuclear is the optimal solution for space travel, energy dense, creates heat and can breed alternative elements. I really believe we should save this for this purpose.

4.  Storage of waste, why make something so hard to deal with in the first place?

5. The Limited supply. If we completely transition to this we have say 200 years of fuel assuming the population keeps growing. 

6. Fuel supply chain. Remove oil and substitute nuclear fuel, ready for invasions to keep the power on.

"""A number of studies, including a study by one of us, have concluded that an 80% decarbonization of the US electric grid could be achieved at reasonable cost"" - https://www.pnas.org/content/114/26/6722 The first 9 references they list are about the feasibility of deeply cutting carbon at reasonable cost. So you will have to unpack your statement a little more clearly with references ideally.

You also haven't done your calculations on the potential of EV storage. Say you have an ev runabout car. You can tell your car that you need only 20 miles range on any one day  so that leaves 95% of that cars battery free for storage. If half of all cars are like this then it still supplies a massive amount of strorage - given most countries are switch to all ev's by 2035. Due to a potential pay back scheme and the low degradation of modern batteries EV owners are keen to implement this scheme.

Another simple way around it is to over supply wind and solar so that the country is usually at 100% renewables and if some strange drop of wind occurs you may have to switch a lot of gas power back on - but still over the year you are at 80% or above renewables. 

Another way I believe you are incorrect is the recent incredibly low price of electricity storage means that wind plus storage looks to be about the same price as levelised gas costs.

Refresh cycles vary from 3-5 years, a computer/server can last 7-10. Especially in a school, where uptime isn't exactly as important as an enterprise.

In the era of sealed, E-Waste generating, all form no function laptops (MS surface, Macs), buying refurbished enterprise laptops is a smart idea. You can usually upgrade the components (designed to be serviced by IT departments) and replace the battery for a long lasting laptop. Enterprise hardware effectively works around the new no function all form trend while still giving you modern hardware. Even buy them new, they're more durable as well!

"Environmental scientist here. Primitivism and degrowth cannot physically solve climate change. It's bizarre that so many of my colleagues have such a huge blind spot on this issue and make this error so often. These are ideologically-driven, not evidence based.

Although the details are debated, it seems likely that as long as CO2 concentration is above natural equilibrium of around 280ppm, we will have continued climate change impacts including melting ice sheets and sea level rise. 

This ""inertia"" in the system means that even if all new GHG emissions dropped to zero tomorrow, we would still have catastrophic impacts from climate change due to the &gt;400ppm CO2 already in the atmosphere. Since it would take at least decades and maybe centuries for natural equilibrium ppm to be restored, climate change is still a huge problem for many decades *even if all humans disappeared tomorrow*.

Lifestyle changes that reduce emissions by reducing consumption don't pull even a single gram of CO2 out of the atmosphere. So they are not a real solution for climate change. Planting trees is of course a good idea, but it cannot sequester enough carbon to fully return us to 280ppm.

It is far too late to solve climate change with primitivism and austerity.

Our only chance to really prevent climate change impacts now is gigantic global CO2 withdrawal megaprojects. We need to take 500+ gigatons of carbon out of the atmosphere within two or three decades, or we will still face catastrophic impacts.

We can't do those megaprojects by destroying the global economy and returning to the trees. Our only chance now is to maintain a thriving economy and focus on technological engineering solutions. The opportunity to solve climate change with social changes alone expired 10-20 years ago.",Futurology

Suing other countries is great. But what do you expect them to do?   With what solutions? Funded by who's money?  Impacting the citizens and children of those countries as well no doubt.  

The easiest thing in the world is to speak up, but it usually doesn't go any farther than that.

"Birth rates drop following drops in infant mortality and increases in life expectancy. You can't withhold development until birthrates drop. It doesn't work like that. You have to develop countries to get their birth rates to drop. Its a key part of [demographic transition theory which has been observed in every country for which we have data.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_transition)

And [we've had a stable amount of children globally since like 2002](https://population.un.org/wpp/Graphs/DemographicProfiles/Line/900). The remaining population growth before we inevitably plateau because of the global trend of falling birth rates we're seeing comes from adults making it to old age, not new births see [this](https://population.un.org/wpp/Graphs/DemographicProfiles/Line/900),  [this](https://population.un.org/wpp/Graphs/Probabilistic/POP/20-64/900) and [this](https://population.un.org/wpp/Graphs/Probabilistic/FERT/TOT/900)

So really we shouldn't be blaming the developing countries for using the same methods we did to get us to where we are. If we want them to do any different its on us with the resources and ability to develop ways for sustainable living if we want them to follow. Because for them its a matter of stopping preventable deaths whereas for us its just getting more efficient.

https://losalamosreporter.com/2020/08/22/get-out-of-the-fluor-nuscale-small-modular-reactor-project/

&gt; the plan to save costs by fabricating the modules at a remote factory and shipping them to the Idaho site has been abandoned. The artful response to my question said that Nuscale engaged with approximately 40 ‚Ä¶ pressure vessel fabricators worldwide and ‚Ä¶ determined that Nuscale will use existing factories ‚Ä¶ in lieu of building its own factory.

&gt;The major module subcomponents will be manufactured at multiple manufacturer locations and shipped to a single location for assembly prior to installing into the facility.‚Äù This signifies the failure of one of the major cost-saving features of the Nuscale project, which was to forestall this exact scenario.

Very few cities have joined the project, and they are already dropping out

&gt;The Fluor/Nuscale scheme to finance the development of this reactor by enlisting many small municipal utilities to subscribe to the power is only about 30% subscribed, and two municipalities recently dropped out while one new one opted in.

If it does not get over a billion in subsidies, they will look at cancelling it entirely.

&gt; UAMPS, as the coalition is known, could still abandon the project altogether. It is planning to convene in mid-September to approve a budget and could decide then to quit. The group says it is in negotiations with the Energy Department for the federal government to provide a $1.4 billion grant, which the utilities say they need to defray the rising cost of buying nuclear power.

It is already exploding in cost, in the normal tradition of nuclear projects.

&gt; Earlier this month, the Utah Taxpayer Association called on cities to withdraw from the project ahead of the Sept. 14 deadline after a closed-door virtual town hall meeting on July 21 where officials warned of project delays, increased costs to cities and towns involved, and ‚Äúdependence on unpredictable federal subsidies.‚Äù

&gt; ‚ÄúThe UAMPS project will lock in 27 municipalities in Utah and several in surrounding states for a share of billions of dollars in costs and unclear risk in the pursuit of a cluster of small modular reactors (SMRs) touted by Oregon-based NuScale Power, which repeatedly has delayed timelines and increased costs associated with its SMRs,‚Äù Utah Taxpayer Association Vice President Rusty Cannon said in an Aug. 4 news release. ‚ÄúThe risky project with massive cost escalations is being conducted largely out of the public eye.‚Äù

Just like NASA invented small camera that we have in phones today, I believe SpaceX will find a solutions to remove radiation on mars, what we can use to clean up on earth as well.

New York have 11 million people, where only 8,4 million actually lives in there. 

If we take worlds population 8,7B shared by 8,4M (new york) we get ~930, what means we need 930 new york city size to fit entire world population today. (If I remember correctly, I did that math very long time ago).

# Backstory

When I saw Elon Musk tear up on¬†60 Minutesfacing the verbal assault from one of his heroes ‚Äî Apollo astronaut Gene Cernan ‚Äî I knew what I had to do.

It has taken a bit of effort over the past months, but today I gave this to Elon and all of the SpaceX team, and it was very well received.


When I saw 60 Minutes, my first thought was to get Gene Cernan (the last man to walk on the moon) to visit SpaceX as Elon had implored. I have been buying¬†space artifactsfrom Gene over the past year and knew how to reach him. I tried to encourage him to visit SpaceX, but to no avail. So I flew out to talk to him face to face. I waited until SpaceX became the first private company to bring a spacecraft back from orbit, and the first to bring cargo to the space station, and the first to bring science experiments back. I also gathered signatures and congratulatory sentiments from the other Apollo heroes first.

Some, like Charlie Duke and Al Bean, were effusive in their praise of SpaceX and the next generation of space explorers. Charlie Duke was excited about a future mission to Mars. Al Bean spent 20 minutes writing rough drafts and crafting each word of his message with the SpaceX team in mind.

Then I approached Gene Cernan, and held my breath. I figured it would be a bit more difficult to break from the social proof of his esteemed colleagues. And so he listened. As with every Apollo astronaut who signed this photo, I was able to talk about SpaceX and answer his questions. Gene was interested in who financed SpaceX ‚Äî what big money interests got it going. I told him that Elon Musk personally financed the company for all of its first $100 million, when no one else would bet on the venture, and he saw it through thick and thin, including the first three launches of the Falcon 1, all of which failed spectacularly. As I told him these stories of heroic entrepreneurship, I could see his mind turning. He found a reconciliation: ‚ÄúI never read any of this in the news. Why doesn‚Äôt the press report on this?‚Äù

Cernan was the last hold out.¬†Neil Armstrong wrote a strongly worded letter to 60 Minutes saying that he was taken out of context. The program editor agreed: ""Armstrong wrote us to say we had not been complete in our description of his testimony. He's right.

&gt;Armstrong is, arguably, the greatest explorer of the 20th Century. I suspect he has admiration for anyone in science or business who sees new possibilities. He may not be confident in a particular federal policy, but I imagine Neil Armstrong stands squarely on the side of those who dare to dream.""

As for Jeff Bezos, it can be argued that he doesn't take a proactive enough role in changing the world for the better. Most billionaires like him just have a ""one-and-done"" business which is the source of their wealth. The way Elon is different is that he has always dumped all of his assets back into his companies: the 21/22 million from the Zip2 sale went into the X.com/Paypal online banking, then all of the money from that went into SpaceX and Tesla. He doesn't actually have any wealth that is not stock in his companies. He literally takes out loans that use his stock as collateral to buy wealthy-person things. 

Taxing someone Elon, and taxing some billionaire who has made their money by corrupt oil or tax-payer money from lobbying or the money from oppressed citizens (looking at you CCP), are two different things.",elonmusk

* While some sources have it as FAA building like [here](http://www.astroman.com.pl/?mod=magazine&amp;a=read&amp;id=738) , some others say it's the DOT building , opposite the National Air and Space Museum.

&gt;The pending launch ignited Musk‚Äôs salesman instincts. He wanted to show the public what his tireless workers had accomplished and drum up some excitement around SpaceX. Musk decided to unveil a prototype of Falcon 1 to the public in December 2003. The company would haul the seven-story-high Falcon 1 across the country on a specially built rig and leave it‚Äîand the SpaceX mobile launch system‚Äîoutside of the Federal Aviation Administration‚Äôs headquarters in Washington, D.C. An accompanying press conference would make it clear to Washington that a modern, smarter, cheaper rocket maker had arrived.

"Thanks for pointing to it. There's a lot more details in this one.

&gt;Washington snubbed Musk just as it had Beal. The establishment‚Äîthe large contractors, members of Congress, even many in NASA‚Äîsaw him as just another multimillionaire with a toy space company. A dilettante who couldn‚Äôt possibly succeed. Few took Musk seriously.

&gt;‚ÄúAt the beginning, we had to beg NASA to even pay attention,‚Äù recalled Lawrence Williams, SpaceX‚Äôs vice president of strategic relations at the time.

&gt;By the end of 2003, Musk decided that if NASA wouldn‚Äôt come to him, he would go to it. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was preparing to celebrate the hundredth anniversary of the Wright Brothers‚Äô first powered flight with a party at the National Air and Space Museum, and Musk decided he‚Äôd show up‚Äîand bring his new rocket.

&gt;For the event, SpaceX loaded the seven-story rocket onto the back of a custom trailer and hauled it cross-country to Washington, DC. With a police escort, it paraded down Independence Avenue, along the National Mall, hallowed ground that had been witness to myriad spectacles, marches, protests. But it had never seen anything quite like this.

&gt;As Musk, then thirty-two years old, parked his rocket outside the headquarters of the FAA, tourists who were headed to the National Air and Space Museum stopped to gawk at the streetside exhibit, even in the freezing temperatures. A shiny, white missile that stretched seven stories long, squatting in the real estate usually reserved for hot dog vendors. A cabbie stopped, agog, as the trailer took up an entire lane of traffic‚Äîat rush hour. The spectacle was pure Silicon Valley swagger, like an Apple product unveiling, but before Steve Jobs had perfected the art of hyping a new gadget to the masses.

&gt;...\*details about the press event*...

&gt;And so this spectacle on the National Mall was more than just a debut for his new rocket. It was a warning shot to such companies as Lockheed Martin and Boeing. Beal had not been able to break their vise grip on the industry. But Musk was armed with a new rocket, and a newly minted fortune that he was ready to burn.

&gt;He was coming for them.",elonmusk

"When weather permitted it was more like 80-90+.

Paid off a house, brought my credit up from 300s to almost 800, and paid off 6 figure medical debt (yay murica.)

I was laid up almost a year before i got that job while my wife worked 2 jobs as we continued to fall behind.

I somehow along the way discovered personal financing and investing books.  Then business and real estate investing books along with it.

That shit sucked and I'm far from rich but I'm comfortably making my way to early retirement.  My only bad debt will be a $650mo mortgage pretty soon.  If things keep going the way i hope i won't even have bills besides cellphones and internet in 5 years.

After that I'll basically be free to just gamble with investments or blindly throw money darts at the board and keep whatever sticks.

I was raised to work hard.  Harder than anyone around me.  It wasn't bad advice.  Just old advice.  I'm proud of the work I've done and it's made it boatloads easier to turn that work ethic from swinging hammers and wrenches into book/real life experiences investing.

It's okay to work hard.  As long as you have a good reason for it and don't get burned out.  If you have the stomach for it there are tons of easier ways to make a living then punching a time clock and buying shiny shit with credit just to make you happy enough to continue the cycle.",elonmusk

But i learned more in a few months of reading personal finance and investing books than i ever would have in school.

On the credibility of that story...

* **Single Source** : The story only comes from two interviews with his estranged father , Errol Musk, in Business Insider SA ( one of which he linked ) , [here](https://www.businessinsider.co.za/how-elon-musks-family-came-to-own-an-emerald-mine-2018-2) and [here](https://www.businessinsider.co.za/elon-musk-sells-the-family-emeralds-in-new-york-2018-2). You will find other articles also but all of them reference back to these two. That's the only source of this , his father.

* **Highly contested source** : Elon has catagorically denied this , every time this has come up and so has his family. Like [here](https://i.imgur.com/EkPyDUt.png) and  [here](https://i.imgur.com/ktOAsYP.png) and many other times.

*  **Character of source** : Important due to how prone sociopaths are to lying.

* **Cartoonish Nature of Story** : Just read the interview and see if you want to believe his cartoonish tales of him being some globe trotting Pablo Escobar like character , mines sending uncut gems directly to their shareholders instead of money , and stories of nationwide jewellery retailer ( Tiffany &amp; Co.¬†on Fifth Avenue in New York ) buying uncut stones from random 16 year olds off the street ( hint : they don't , maybe your local pawn shop might but these companies have supply chains ). **Seriously , read it yourself.**

* **Reason for lying** : In each of the two interviews , the point of the story was to come to the conclusion , as shown in the below excerpts from the same ,

 &gt;It was that lifestyle, Errol says, that turned Elon into the kind of merchant adventurer who would later¬†break the rules of the motoring business¬†with Tesla, then go on to¬†change spaceflight with SpaceX. ( *From first interview* )

"&gt;Has he actually made any considerable progress on the brain implants that wasn't already there?

Good writeup on the integration involved.

&gt;For a device that small, the team packed an admirable array of features into it. The ‚ÄúLink‚Äù device has over 1,000 channels, which can be individually activated. This is on par with¬†Neuropixel, the cr√®me de la cr√®me of neural probes with 960 recording channels that‚Äôs currently used widely in research, including by the Allen Institute for Brain Science.

&gt;Compared to the Utah Array, a legendary implant system used for brain stimulation in humans with only 256 electrodes, the Link has an obvious edge up in terms of pure electrode density.

&gt;What‚Äôs perhaps most impressive, however, is its onboard processing for neural spikes‚Äîthe electrical pattern generated by neurons when they fire. Electrical signals are fairly chaotic in the brain, and filtering spikes from noise, as well as separating trains of electrical activity into spikes, normally requires quite a bit of processing power. This is why in the lab, neural spikes are usually recorded offline and processed using computers, rather than with on-board electronics.

&gt;The problem gets even more complicated when considering wireless data transfer from the implanted device to an external smartphone. Without accurate and efficient compression of those neural data, the transfer could tremendously lag, drain battery life, or heat up the device itself‚Äîsomething you don‚Äôt want happening to a device stuck inside your skull.

&gt;To get around these problems, the team has been working on algorithms that use ‚Äúcharacteristic shapes‚Äù of electrical patterns that look like spikes to efficiently identify individual neural firings. The data is processed on the chip inside the skull device. Recordings from each channel are filtered to root out obvious noise, and the spikes are then detected in real time. Because different types of neurons have their characteristic ways of spiking‚Äîthat is, the ‚Äúshape‚Äù of their spikes are diverse‚Äîthe chip can also be configured to detect the particular spikes you‚Äôre looking for. This means that in theory the chip could be programmed to only capture the type of neuron activity you‚Äôre interested in‚Äîfor example, to look at inhibitory neurons in the cortex and how they control neural information processing.

&gt;These processed spike data are then sent out to smartphones or other external devices through Bluetooth to enable wireless monitoring. Being able to do this efficiently has been a stumbling block in wireless brain implants‚Äîraw neural recordings are too massive for efficient transfer, and automated spike detection and compression of that data is difficult, but a necessary step to allow neural interfaces to finally ‚Äúcut the wire.‚Äù

&gt;Link has other impressive features. For one, the battery life lasts all day, and the device can be charged at night using inductive charging. From my subsequent conversations with the team, it seems like there will be alignment lights to help track when the charger is aligned with the device. What‚Äôs more, the Link itself also has an internal temperature sensor to monitor for over-heating, and will automatically disconnect if the temperature rises above a certain threshold‚Äîa very necessary safety measure so it doesn‚Äôt overheat the surrounding skull tissue.

"**On Paypal**

Elon founded a company called X.com which later merged with another called coinfinity, which was co-founded by Peter Thiel. X constituted half the post-merger equity and more than half the employees of the merged company which later became PayPal. He lead the company in it's formative years and even pivoted to the current business model.

&gt;The original business plan focused on allowing people to transfer money electronically via the Palm hand-held computer. But Musk quickly saw that the ‚Äúkiller‚Äù application would be a system that allowed the secure e-mailing of payments using any type of PC, according to Sacks, the former PayPal COO.

From [David Saks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_O._Sacks) ,  founding COO and product leader of¬†PayPal till sale to ebay, in [Article](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2003-apr-22-fi-spacex22-story.html)

By the time he was replaced with Thiel , the business model was already figured out , the company had already scaled and was one of the largest payment providers. Neither the business model nor the end product saw major changes over that period.

&gt;not his orginal idea

Yes , confinity had a product called PayPal , but the idea isn't the main thing. There were also many well funded competitors already, such as Citigroup with their c2it email payment service, BancOne's emoneymail, Yahoo's PayDirect, Western Union's BidPay, etc. Even X had a email payment service. What mattered was turning it into the market leader and a money making one at that, which included

* Solving PayPal's problem of losing money because people would instantly take out the money to their bank account after transfers. The key to making it a success was incentivising people to keep their money there by offering bank like services. Paypal started offering things like money market fund and debit card , borrowed over from X which managed to do just that.

* Lowering their charges. The main thing that set PayPal apart ( minimising credit card transfer and their charges by enabling bank to bank transfer where they authenticated accounts by sending a small unique amount that the user had to then enter ) was also developed under his tenure.",elonmusk
"&gt;**tesla - Not a orginal fouder**

Elon wanted to commercialize [a prototype called the T-Zero by AC Propulsion.](https://i.imgur.com/nPj6twT.png) As he didn't have the time to run both spacex and the new company , the AC zero guys sent him to another team looking to commercialize it.

&gt;AC Propulsion developed the idea, and both Eberhard and Musk initially approached the San Dimas, California, company to build the car. 

&gt;Both Eberhard and Musk saw the importance ‚Äì and potential ‚Äì of what Gage and Cocconi had created. When Eberhard and Musk approached them individually to prod them into taking the next step and produce the vehicle, Gage opted instead to introduce Musk to Eberhard and get back to work creating¬†the eBox, an electrified Scion xB that Gage considered more practical and economical.

[Source](https://www.wired.com/2009/06/tesla-founder/)

When Musk approached Martin , the business consisted of nothing but an unfunded business plan to commercialize the T-Zero. While there was a basic corporation in place, Tesla hadn‚Äôt even registered or obtained the trademark to its name and had no formal offices or assets.

To save legal fees, they even copied the SpaceX articles of incorporation and bylaws for Tesla. Even the Tesla logo was designed by RO Studio, same guys Musk had hired to design the SpaceX logo.

Again from previous wired article article

&gt;And Musk didn't act sooner to replace Eberhard, either in the early days when one member of the management team sought his ouster or at the series C round of funding when a top-tier venture capitalist conditioned an investment offer on Eberhard's departure (In both cases, Musk backed Eberhard). Both men have privately, and sometimes publicly, regretted those decisions.

Elon supported Martin even though others protested that he wasn't running the company properly. When it came to light he was lying about the costs of the roadster , Musk ousted reluctantly replaced him, running both companies and pouring every bit of money he had into it, saving it.

Later Martin sued to make the first two sole founders , while Elon wanted all of the early team ( including JB , who joined after him , and he himself bought on ) as co-founders.

[Judge strikes down request that former CEO Martin Eberhard be declared one of only two founders of the automotive start-up.](https://www.cnet.com/news/teslas-musk-gloats-over-eberhard-ruling/)

&gt; A San Mateo County Superior Court judge on Wednesday denied former Tesla Motors CEO Martin Eberhard's request that he be declared one of only two Tesla founders, according to a statement released by Tesla Motors late Wednesday night.

&gt;He does do technical work. He is intimately involved in the design process, though I doubt that includes making 3D CAD designs of individual parts, programming flight software, or anything like that.

\- Reliability Analysis Engineer at SpaceX

&gt;Elon is both the Chief Executive Officer and¬†Chief¬†Technology¬†Officer¬†of SpaceX, so of course he does more than just ‚Äòsome¬†very technical work‚Äô. He is integrally involved in the actual design and engineering of the rocket, and at least touches every other aspect of the business (but I would say the former takes up much more of his mental real estate). Elon is an engineer at heart, and that‚Äôs where and how he works best.

\- Former Head of Quality Assurance at SpaceX

Sourced from [here](https://www.quora.com/Does-Elon-Musk-do-some-very-technical-work-code-design-etc-at-SpaceX) . I have gone though LinkedIn and other details online and don't think these people are lying about their positions. Other anecdotes can be found on places like hackernews but without profiles can't be verified.

Also excerpts from [Tom Mueller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Mueller) , Former CTO of Propulsion at SpaceX and main guy behind the Merlin engines, speaking [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/6b043z/_/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacexlounge/comments/hcn6pc/_/) to a very small group of students , where the stream was later removed , but the community saved the transcript.

&gt;We‚Äôll have, you know, a group of people sitting in a room, making a key decision. And everybody in that room will say, you know, basically, ‚ÄúWe need to turn left,‚Äù and Elon will say ‚ÄúNo, we‚Äôre gonna turn right.‚Äù You know, to put it in a metaphor. And that‚Äôs how he thinks. He‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúYou guys are taking the easy way out; we need to take the hard way.‚Äù 

&gt;And, uh, I‚Äôve seen that hurt us before, I‚Äôve seen that fail, but I‚Äôve also seen‚Äî where nobody thought it would work‚Äî it was the right decision. It was the harder way to do it, but in the end, it was the right thing.

&gt;...

&gt;And now we have the lowest-cost, most reliable engines in the world. And it was basically because of that decision, to go to do that. So that‚Äôs one of the examples of Elon just really pushing‚Äî he always says we need to push to the limits of physics.

&gt;Elon is brilliant. He‚Äôs involved in just about everything. He understands everything. If he asks you a question, you learn very quickly not to go give him a gut reaction.

&gt;He wants answers that get down to the fundamental laws of physics. One thing he understands really well is the physics of the rockets. He understands that like nobody else. The stuff I have seen him do in his head is crazy.

&gt;He can get in discussions about flying a satellite and whether we can make the right orbit and deliver Dragon at the same time and solve all these equations in real time. It‚Äôs amazing to watch the amount of knowledge he has accumulated over the years.

"The first one is basically from Martin. So let's get through all the bullshit he is sprouting ( Prepare for multiple edits )

* **First he steals credit for the idea to use lithium ion batteries.**

 &gt;¬†I had a neighbor named Steve Casner, who had a Toyota RAV4 electric, and I always had an EV in my front yard, so we got to talking. He was working at a company with Martin Eberhard, so he told Martin about me. Martin called me, **and he had all these schemes, and I was sort of talking through what the realities were. We were just converting the tzero over to lithium-ion batteries.** He got involved with that. He actually put some investor money ‚Äì a small amount ‚Äì into AC Propulsion, and we finished the conversion of the tzero to lithium-ion batteries.¬†

 [From Tom Gage , co-creator of the T-Zero](https://chargedevs.com/features/tom-gage-on-zev-mandates-teslas-early-days-bmws-ev-commitment-and-v2g-tech/)

* Long purple prose confirming the same thing , that **all they had was a business plan with no funding.** No assets or anything.

* Goes into prose about coming up with Tesla Motors name but forgets to tell that, in all his wisdom , **Martin didn't even register the trademark or check if anyone had the trademark already.** So they had to go through the naming process all over again. Tesla was this much way from being called Faraday motors.

* **Lies about approaching Musk.** [We literally have the emails](https://i.imgur.com/xLGY9GM.png) where Tom tells him about the two teams and introduces them.

 &gt; In October 2003, Harold Rosen, the brother of Ben Rosen (chairman of Compaq, who bought Elon's first company), invited him to lunch with himself and JB Straubel. They told him about a company called¬†AC Propulsion¬†that had developed an all electric sports car called the¬†Tzero.

 &gt;A few months later, Elon met with Tom Gage, president of AC Propulsion, who gave him a test drive in the Tzero, which confirmed their claims. Over the course of several months, he tried repeatedly to convince AC Propulsion to commercialize the Tzero, but they were not interested. When he said he was moving forward with creating an electric car company anyway, Tom Gage offered to introduce him to one of two groups that were interested in commercializing the Tzero concept.

 Every party to this have confirmed this story.

* **A lot of long drawn out history of the company , just cutting musk out.** 

 [From Martin's own blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20100204030555/http://www.teslamotors.com/blog2/?p=7)

 &gt;Elon and the Tesla team spent a lot of time ‚Äì and several trips to England ‚Äì working with Barney to perfect the styling.

 Or how JB was hired and appointed by Musk himself. Recall him from the meeting with ACP? He knew him from long before from Stanford.

* I like how he presents himself taking the credit himself ( something he is akin to doing as presented above üëÜ) and Musk recognising it and fighting it as something negative against Elon. Too bad Musk was already aware of these tendencies from his experience with past 2 companies and recognised it early on.

* &gt;All the while, Tesla rolled along without a chief financial officer. Between those factors, the finances at the company were getting ""very murky,"" Eberhard said.¬†

The article says they want to do that in order to save fuel. But fuel is about the cheapest part of a Starship-mission. 

And because they don't mention it, we can safely assume that the ""detour"" to Venus increases the travel time considerably. But that's exactly what we don't want to happen. The fewer days in space the less problems with radiation. With a flyby at Venus this problem would even amplify itself because of the proximity of the sun.

"No. No it isnt, ""some guy who has watched youtube videos"". It isn't even close. It doesnt matter if conditions in the Vensusian atmosphere are closer to Earth. Literally any off world infrastructure will be build as if it is in a vacuum and any trip outside will require a full EVA suit. 

When ""developing the literal ground you build on"" is a huge massive project in and of itself PLUS there are no usable resources AND no water... no. 


You are just latching onto the hysterical BS contrarian idea of Venusian cloud cities, which is just that... an idea. Like, you've *heard* people talk about this. You dont really have any understanding at all about the relative strengths of Mars or Venus but you've HEARD people talk about how Venus' atmosphere would be great for colonizing with cloud cities. So Venus has come up as a topic so you'll just repeat it.

Ah alright then,elonmusk
"&gt;Saving fuel has nothing do with cost

With traditional launchers the fuel for the upper stages or the exploration stage takes a considerable about of the stupidly expensive payload. If you can reduce the fuel mass, you can increase the actually useful payload, without making the mission even more expensive. Traditional mission profiles to Mars call for several fuel launches on expendable launchers. Obviously you want to minimise the number of fuel launches. If you can cut back even one launch with a flyby at venus, you can easily save 200 millions on your mission, making it more likely to be approved by Congress. 

With Starship nothing of that is a concern.


&gt;What is a flyby at the sun?

Bad wording by me. I meant a flyby at venus. Such a trajectory brings you closer to the sun and thus increases the radiation density.",elonmusk

"It would not based on these assumptions:

Starship empty weight: 117,934kg

Starship volume: 1000 cubic meters

Venus atmosphere density (surface): 65 kg/cubic meter

The density of the an empty starship is 117 kg/cubic meter. So even at the surface it would not be buoyant. Even if we pulled a vacuum inside starship. 

To achieve a liveable temperature of 30-40c it's seems we would need a floating base around 40km high with an atmospheric pressure showing around 2 bar'ish. This zone is a sulphuric acid haze zone. It seems completely plausible to create a craft that would be rigid and buoyant at that altitude.

"Philanthropy is essentially just a way for rich people to boost their personal branding and feel good about themselves, killing two birds in one stone.

There‚Äôs an old Chinese proverb that says:‚ÄùGive a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime‚Äù That‚Äôs the biggest difference between Bill Gates and Elon Musk, Bill Gates is buying you fish &amp; chips for a day, Elon Musk teaches you how to fish. Al-tough a more accurate metaphor when it comes to both men‚Äôs philanthropic endeavors would be that Bill Gates is trying to cure cancer by only treating the symptoms whereas Elon Musk ignores the symptoms but try to find the source of the tumors in order to cut it out.

At first glance Bill Gates seems to be a much more generous and influential philanthropist than Elon Musk, Gates Foundation commits $258.3 million to cure malaria in developing countries and provides free Malaria vaccine in India.

Elon Musk on the other hand, makes electric cars and created his own foundation that funds clean energy research and science advocacy (see the amazing ‚Äôs answer for more details on this), which appears to be much less impressive than Bill Gates‚Äôs ‚Äúgood deeds‚Äù, in fact, I can‚Äôt even count how many times I have seen the question:‚ÄùWhy don‚Äôt Elon Musk just donate his money to solve world hunger instead of squandering it to explore Mars?‚Äù posted and retweeted by scientifically illiterate people all over the world, and they couldn‚Äôt be more wrong.

For example, China's polluted air kills 4,400 a day, India‚Äôs Malaria infected mosquitoes kill 2,7 a day, so Elon Musk‚Äôs endeavors(open source electric car patents and clean energy research) has the potential to save 4,400 lives per day in China and will lead to the creation of a lot of jobs, on the other hand, Bill Gates‚Äôs endeavors although commendable will ‚Äúonly‚Äù save 2,7 lives per day in India. So even though Elon Musk is donating less money to charities than Bill Gates, Elon is actually being more philanthropic than Bill Gates.

[About the Aero L-39 Albatros](http://twinandturbine.com/article/l-39-albatros-fly-fighter-jet/)

After Elon Musk made his¬†first millions¬†from the sales of Zip2 and PayPal, he invested much of the money into founding SpaceX in 2002 and co-founding Tesla in 2003. But in addition to launching two of the world's most famous startups, Musk also devoted some cash to his love of aviation.


Musk describes flying it [here](https://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2003/10/06/350397/index.htm)

&gt;Probably the most fun plane I have is a Russian fighter jet. It's called an L-39. It has a Czech air frame, a Ukrainian engine, Russian avionics. It's what they used to train their fighter pilots on, so it's incredibly acrobatic. But your butt hurts if you fly in it for more than an hour. The seats are really hard.

&gt;You can do eight Gs in that plane. You pretty much need a G-suit, or you could black out. I might go up to five, but that's the most. Five Gs means that's five times your body weight. It's pretty hard to move. You feel very heavy. Your cheeks are being sucked down. If you maintain five Gs for too long, it's very hard to concentrate. You start seeing red dots.

&gt;Probably the most fun flight I did was with another L-39 in Nevada. It's kind of open airspace, so we did a tail chase, where we basically followed another plane through the mountains at very low altitude. Literally, it was just like in Top Gun. You're no more than a couple of hundred feet above the ground, following the contour of the mountains. We came up to a mountain, did a vertical climb up the side of it, inverted. Turned upside down. Yeah, that was fun. It's like a roller coaster. Only you go much farther up and down.

Him on stopping , from [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2008/09/24/DI2008092402502.html)

&gt;Sadly, I don't pilot myself any more, but do have a (lapsed) multi-engine IFR rating. I have to work when I fly and have too many thoughts in my head to pay the necessary attention to the plane -- I can be absentminded at times, which is a really bad habit for a pilot.",elonmusk

There may have been a few bumps along the way (I'm looking at you roadster and model S production) 

But look at them now. Tesla stock is insane and they're cars are rated some of the most reliable and safest cars in the market for a budget. 

Elon not only helped the company but saved and changed it, but he's not the only one there we can't forget about fanz (the lead designer at tesla)

Tesla are fantastic and their consistent improvements on full self driving and autopilot are basically unheard from other automotive companies (that I'm aware of) not to mention the updates to the software and adding new games and features like Spotify and Netflix. 

Also the app, we can't forget about the app YOU CAN CALL AND SUMMON YOUR CAR TO YOU FROM A MOTHER FUCKING APP, YOU CAN EVEN OPEN YOUR CAR FROM THE APP! No need for a key when YOU ARE THE KEY. I haven't even seen another car company do stuff like that. 

My names josh and thanks for coming to my Ted talk rank about tesla and their impact on the automotive industry.

The other key part beyond the passion is those extra house _paying off_ for you. If you work mega hours and there is no payoff you will burn out.

If there is not enough dopamine to counteract the noradreinaline, there is a ""noradrenaline quit system"" which makes you give up at what you are doing (whether that is running a marathon, studying schoolwork or working on some task).

Stupid law and stupid judge. It's about [this tweet](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/998454539941367808?s=19)

&gt;Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues &amp; give up stock options for nothing? Our safety record is 2X better than when plant was UAW &amp; everybody already gets healthcare.

which is clearly talking about the fact that other companies with the UAW do not have stock options for their employees , which he even clarifies [here](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/999415738967277568?s=19)

&gt;Exactly. UAW does not have individual stock ownership as part of the compensation at any other company.

And to put some source behind what he said in the tweet

Same plant under GM/Toyota under the same UAW , before Tesla took over 

&gt;Under Toyota and GM leadership, the factory had an average recordable incident rate of 12.6 between 2003 and 2009, and in each of these years, the numbers were worse than the industry average. However, Tesla recorded a rate of just 6.2 last year.¬†

&gt;**Fired an employee one day before his stock options vested**

Weird he made so much noise about this lawsuit and that back in 2017 , but no peep since then. Maybe there was a legitimate reason to be fired.

&gt;**Fired staff after promising them they could take unpaid time off if they didn‚Äôt feel comfortable returning to work during COVID**

When they were open early in defiance of the County , not indefinitely and that too without notice. 

You want Tesla to keep them forever on the rolls, while they collect unemployment benefits sitting at home, while all their other colleagues are working?

"No, people in Norway dont buy Tesla for enviorment or political reasons. (Comment above was about American left leaning people, not Norwegian). The reason to the current drop of Tesla in Norway is because Government start to be more fair. Electric car owners have to pay for the same things fossil fuel car owners have to pay.

When new things come to market, there are lack of regulations, and people exploit it. Norway is a very slow performing government, that‚Äôs why I like German/Danish government cuz they are faster at regulations etc.

Gen X basically made British punk rock a trend so its not a surprise Coupland used a British band name.

No no Gen X is a cohort of individuals who grow up in the environment specific to the United States between 1964-5 &amp; 1979-1980

&gt;""Speculation over the name X √Ü A-12 has been a major topic of conversation since the couple welcomed the baby boy into the world on Monday, with questions over what the characters mean.

&gt;The Canadian musician -- real name Claire Elise Boucher -- previously explained that √Ü is the Elven spelling of AI, which is shorthand for artificial intelligence.

&gt;""It's just X, like the letter X. Then A.I. Like how you said the letter A then I,""¬†wrote¬†Grimes on Thursday in response to a query on Instagram.""

Later in that article:

&gt;""She explained ""X"" stood for ""the unknown variable,"" while √Ü -- AI -- was shorthand for artificial intelligence and translates to ""love"" in several languages.""

So it means artificial intelligence in elven, but also love in multiple languages (including Japanese and Chinese, as we revealed in this thread).",elonmusk

Before battery day there was the split day. Prior to the split, people were hiking up the price. After the split, it is profit taking.

Here is the news that you should consider: 

1. Tesla is no longer the number 1 selling EV car in many European and the Chinese market. 

2.  VW is now in the game. To compete with the 3 and the Y.

3. Taycan is cannibalizing workers from other areas of Audi because they can't keep up with the demand.

4. Nikola shares jumped because of GM getting in. 

5. Tesla service issues and end of quarter shoddiness have become permanent features. 

6. Battery day reveal will HAVE to be siginificantly  overpowering in its value to negate the bad news and competition.  Competition that used to be not thought of but is now a reality.

High school my ass these kids look like 8th graders if that.,elonmusk
"It's from Bryanston high school yearbook , where he was there for Grade 8 and 9.

&gt;In¬†South Africa, high school begins at¬†grade 8 (age 13‚Äì14). Students study for five years, at the end of which they write a¬†Matriculation examination.

"I entered high school at 11 years old. 11-18 or from 1st Form to Upper 6th Form (7 years). In 5th Form you do your O‚ÄôLevels. In Upper 6th, you do for your A-Levels exams. Circa 1973, England, boarding school.

Former British colonies followed a similar schooling pattern.",elonmusk

"1: what does form mean

2: what‚Äôs an O‚Äô-Level

3: what‚Äôs an A-Level

American here, our school system is stupid",elonmusk
It seems to be a similar system to the British one,elonmusk
"Form roughly equals American Grade, but the numbering system is different. Think of Form 1 as Grade 6.

O-Level = Ordinary Level. Examination at 16years old. Roughly equivalent to High School Diploma, except you are graded on each individual subject, not just given a overall passing grade. For many, it‚Äôs the end of formal schooling and they enter the workforce.

A-Level = Advanced Level. Examination at 18 years old. Roughly equivalent to end of 1st year of College in the US.

After this is University (US College), with a 4 year degree course ending in a BA or BSc. Then Masters and PhD degrees, like in the US.",elonmusk
"Because maybe Elon was/is in Germany

And was allowed to test drive VW‚Äòs new electric car",elonmusk
"Got it. Thanks!

That makes so much more sense. I don‚Äôt understand how anyone thinks the US schooling system is ok. I‚Äôm a senior in high school (so I 5th or 6th form?) and I know of at least 20-30 kids in my grade that can‚Äôt read, let alone anyone else.

"I‚Äôll start by saying that I don‚Äôt dislike Elon fundamentally as a person, but I do dislike him as a businessperson.

Many of the members of Anti-Elon communities are leftists, which is a very important aspect of their hostility. There‚Äôs no doubt that most people find the exploitation of labour deplorable, leftists take that to another level. My personal dislike of Elon comes largely from the Bolivia incident and his response to it and (and this is the main thing) his use of the cobalt mines in the DRC. I can forgive his other wrongdoings as I will attribute them to his inexperience in certain fields, not saying that all leftists will feel the same. 

I know that some people in those communities do dislike him as a person, his transphobia towards Grimes is something that people bring up very often (which I will give him the benefit of the doubt and assume he didn‚Äôt know how damaging his words could be).",elonmusk

I watched the video and I think there is validity to applying this argument across the political spectrum. There is no Marxist apocolypse or Conservative plague. There are opinions and positions. The best anyone can do is reference as many sources as possible and take in the information yourself. To truly do this, you must be vulnerable, because sometimes the truth really hurts... and it's often difficult to accept that your opinion can change, that something you have held for so long may be false.

 20 million people die of easily preventable deaths annually because they do not have the resources to save themselves. To put it into perspective, given the holocaust took four years, that's about 7.2 holocausts every year. Elon Musk could use his wealth to save literally millions of lives without even affecting his own lifestyle. He is so wealthy, he could give away dozens of billions of dollars,  perhaps just stop one of those seven holocausts happening annually, and his life wouldn't change at all.

Imagine that in some remote place on Earth, a large population suddenly loses all their food production and without outside help, would starve. If the costs of taking the food there are greater than what the locals could spend buying it, nobody would give them the help they need. That's awful, and shouldn't happen in any good system.

Now guess what, it happens in every country. Lots of people starve because there isn't enough profit to be made selling them food. Even though enough food is produced, and a lot of it ends up in the trash.",elonmusk
"I think you're grasping at straws at this point. 

While it's true he's one of the richest people in the world now, one cannot just give out billions and still maintain a controlling stock in his companies.

To say that he can save millions of lives without affecting his own lifestyle (implying that he hasn't) is also offputting in a way. It's very possible to donate secretly btw, and he has done that.

Communism can be the failed attempts where it never actually happened and was more of a fascist dictatorship, or the never realized concept like you mentioned. Just saying ""Communism bad"" is pretty silly because it has never happened. Either way that is not what I am trying to talk about.

What has actually happened is these ""numbskulls"" you are talking about wanting wealth redistribution (better word is socialism). Also known as taxes, benefiting society. So when a mega billionaire like Bezos makes a shit ton of money and pays barely any taxes for his corporation and treats employees like shit, people want some wealth redistribution.

Should i also?..‚Äù it‚Äôs possible Bezos selling his shares and taking, example, 1 billion dollars out, the share price impact from doing that could result in him losing 5% of every share, which would be a fuckton more than 1 billion worth of $.

"No, that‚Äôs a good idea though. I‚Äôm interested to know how much one would cost, I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs probably 60 for the base plates and then 50ish for the pieces but I‚Äôll have to price it out to know for sure.",elonmusk

"(Ignore grammar mistakes, I'm german as you can imagine) 

T√ºbingen is a city in Baden W√ºrttemberg (Germany) and my hometown. It's not a huge but also not a small city. T√ºbingen is famous for it's university, many students and science. 

The vaccine manufacturer CureVac has its headquarters here. Tesla cooperates with CureVac and Elon visited them to see a new 3D printing technology, which could speed up the production of a Corona vaccination. 

MONDAY:
When I read that Elon would visit T√ºbingen, I was over the moon. Elon is my idol and an inspiration for me, I'm following his work for years now. That Elon Musk would come into my city was just surreal. 
Sadly I was on vacation, I knew I wouldn't have the chance to see him. I thought: ""If I can't see him, my friends should."" so I told all my friends in T√ºbingen that Elon would come. They are also fans and were really excited too. 

In the beginning it wasn't even clear, if Elon would come directly to T√ºbingen but then CureVacs press officer confirmed it. 
Elon would arrive on Tuesday at a unknown time at the CureVac HQ but he didn't want press. It would be ""undercover‚Äú.
Knowing he would definitely come, we read news articles and searched through social media. We wanted to calculate the rough time when we could see him, arriving at CureVac. We had a battle plan! ‚Üì
1. Wait in front of the CureVac building for Elon to arrive
2. Take a look at him when he goes into it.
3. Maybe ask him for photo. (A photo with Elon Musk is our biggest dream.) 

TUESDAY MORNING:
At 7 AM, 3 of my friends went to the CureVac building. Then they prepared them self to wait. 
With time more fans joined them. Some Teslas, driven by enthusiastic fans, parked on the parking lot. 
After a few hours CureVac had to order security to the building, because they were so many fans waiting. 
You have to know that the whole thing was a big event for us locals. Reporters were also waiting and there even was a live feed with the latest news. 

TUESDAY 4 PM: 
After 8 hours of waiting in heavy rainfall a Model X showed up at the end of the street. 
In it, on the passenger seat, was Elon. 
The car drove immediately in the underground car park, Elon didn't even greeted the fans. The local reporters shot some pictures.
Some fans (among them my friends) were dispirited and sad because they only saw Elon for a few seconds through the car window, they left. Others didn't give up and luckily stayed.


TUESDAY 8 PM:
After hours of meetings Elon came out of the building. He was surrounded by CureVac employees and bodyguards and had a black bandana wrapped around his face.  
He walked across the field in front of the CureVac building to bath in the crowd of the (around 50) fans, who waited. 
As far as I know everybody kept distance and he only exchanged a couple of words with a few people. Many fans made selfies from a distance. 
There was a engineering student, who had a sign with the words ""I WANT TO WORK FOR YOU!"". He showed Elon a self-built fully electric motorcycle. Elon was very interested and they talked a for a while. 

After 15 minutes of interaction with fans and reporters Elon left to drive to the airport.",elonmusk

Everything he's ever done is a new product. There was no Tesla before Musk. Electric vehicles were pathetic. No cheap rockets before Musk. Space flight was massively expensive and ruled by government agencies. Number one innovator because he's taking on and successfully disrupting the industries that rule the world. Energy.

"&gt; Everything he's ever done is a new product. 

No. Maybe, arguably, a few things he's ""done"" were actually new. But not everything. Neuralink for example is nothing new. The current state of art is way ahead of what Neuralink is hoping to achieve. They have been a lot of commentaries by neuroscientists recently on this.

&gt; Electric vehicles were pathetic.  

Implicitly, you admit that electric vehicles existed before. They were not good enough for your taste. Whatever you mean by pathetic. The best thing you can say is that Tesla is about to have success in offering attractive electric vehicles. Nothing new. Just better.

&gt;   Space flight was massively expensive and ruled by government agencies. 

Again you admit that he did not invent Space Flight. He just participated in making it cheaper and more efficient, as a businessman. Here I have to admit that his role is indeed innovatory. 

All of this is still not enough to make him the leading innovator in the world. SpaceX might be his only innovation.",elonmusk

If musk dies, he's hired excellent talent, at this point it is hard to say if Tesla's lead is far enough ahead to weather something like his death but if it were to happen I'd be surprised if they didn't at least become the energy tech giant we expect.",elonmusk

It would be equally ridiculous to say ""well I'm sure they thought that"" as an answer to ANY engineering question, that was my point. It's a thought terminating non answer that detracts from the discussion of people actual trying to talk about the engineering problems 

&gt; And that false claim I made doesn't diminish my point in any way, it was tangential. Also, I forgot. I knew that, but forgot. That happens. Still, doesn't impact my argument.

It really does impact your argument and diminish your point, entirely. Why else would you delete it? Your only comment that said anything substantive or falsifiable, and you erase it after its easily proven false. When your whole initial point was ""I am willing to bet they thought of it"" and people ask why, and you give the reasons... 

That's not a tangent. That's called supporting your point with evidence. And when your evidence failed for being factually wrong, you deleted it and said ""ahh it was just an irrelevant tangent""

&gt; you really think they didn't have someone think ""what if something breaks down inside the tunnel?""

This is an appeal to incredulity. It doesn't matter how dumb you make it sound, people make mistakes all the time, and its valid to discuss that possibility. The burden of proof is on you, my dude.

"This money isn't as useful to most people as they think it is.

Suppose you take all this essentially dead (not circulating) money and redistribute it.

Now it circulates and velocity of money increases, so inflation increases proportionally. No additional goods or real wealth will be produced by redistributing this money. People see it as some kind of virtual panacea, yet it is but a mirage. Real wealth in a nation is not its currency, but rather the goods and services produced by its collective citizens.

And the greatest irony? Those that are the biggest proponents of taxation to solve this inequality problem are usually the same people that are okay with deficit spending and money creation that led to this situation in the first place. Almost all new money created is ending up at the top. When beloved liberal governments around the world print money like mad, they do so full well knowing it will all end up at the top. Yet the world population is complicit in this scheme to an alarming degree.

Unfortunately it apparent at this point that it will take far too long for the average person to realize the sinister simplicity of this scheme and fight against it. At least until it is too late to avoid severe social unrest.",Futurology

This can be best seen as here [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity\_sector\_in\_New\_Zealand#Generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_sector_in_New_Zealand#Generation)

Where it shows Annual Electricity generation and has a percentage that is Renewable. In 1975 they had 90% renewable electricity generation. With this fraction only falling to 66% at the lowest in 2005, but since then usage of coal and gas has fallen in half from 14k GWh to 7k GWH, but Hydro produced a stable 24k to 26k GHW change in this time with the majority of the slack picked up by geothermal (another option available in very few regions) 3k GWh to 7.5k GWH and some wind going from 0.6k GWh to 2k GWh with solar only getting 0.1k GWh.

So it looks like they can easily go fully renewable (for electricity they are still quite bad on fuel usage) and will and they did cut down of Fossil fuels but the task wasn't difficult as most other countries have it. They have done a Dam good job, and much better than Australia but they have a massive advantage.

"My cousin works in a small local government in China and I want to share a story.

Most of the constituents are farmers who take care of their own heating. Traditionally it means truckloads of coal shipped to the villages late autumn. Ever since the Paris Climate Agreement, the government massively subsidised clean coal (Sulfur-free coal powder mixed with clay) making it as cheap as dirty coal. The idea is to slowly move from coal to biogas, but they can be stubborn.

Lots and lots of small or medium coal mines went out of business. My cousin's office received death threats, mob attacks, assassination attempts on one of the investigation teams from the province, bribery, at one point their office building was blocked by 4 tons of cow shit. 

Eventually they stopped, presumably because they are out of business and/or Cow poo. And the few left over started rumours saying clean coal is ""less hot"" or ""poisonous"".

"You are completely wrong. Einstein's explanation has been completely verified experimentally by Robert Millikan who spent ten years trying to disprove the Law of the photoelectric effect. He confirmed Einstein's theory in **EVERY DETAIL**   He did publish his results although he was unhappy about them. Your pathetic attempt is pure nonsense.

 A photon does not exist and cannot be detected? I suggest you read up on the Compton effect which absolutely proves that it does. 
 Over and over again Einstein's work has been verified experimentally.
 The photon anti-bunching effect is another experiment that shows photons exist. These three things kick your claim of no such thing as a photon right in the balls. I can just see you bent over clutching your crotch right now.

BTW Einstein dealt with the emission of electrons and he was responsible for classification of the duality of light waves and particles (photons) which no one had done before. It was his insight of light as particles that led to a major contribution in quantum mechanics. 

 &gt;I will not find a single highly regarded physicist that claims photons are real. 

How about Einstein himself? Or https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03280 (Hope you have a subscription.) He is more highly acclaimed than anyone you can cite to the contrary. 

https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Challenge-Second-Foundations-Mechanics/dp/076372470X/ Here is some *light* reading about the reality of photons.

Classical theory cannot explain the six experimental results found in the area of research.  Only one of them.  Einstein's theory does explain them all.. 


The number of electrons emitted increases as you increase the intensity of the light. (Higher intensity means more total energy, which means more photons. More photons means more electrons knocked loose.)

The energy of the electrons emitted does not depend on the intensity at all. (The electron energy is whatever's left of a single photon energy after you supply the energy needed for the work function. The total number of photons has nothing to do with it.)

As you vary the frequency of the light, you find that there is a frequency below which no electrons are emitted, no matter how high an intensity you use. (If the photon energy is less than the energy required to free an electron, it doesn't matter how many photons you throw at the system, nothing's going to happen.)

Above the cutoff frequency, the energy of the electrons emitted increases linearly as you increase the frequency. (The higher the frequency, the higher the photon energy, and the higher the photon energy, the more energy is left for the electron.)

There's no time delay. No matter how low you make the intensity, if electrons are emitted at all, they come out instantly. (One photon is all it takes. You don't need to build up energy slowly.)

If you keep a constant intensity, and vary the frequency, you find fewer electrons coming out at higher frequencies. (Intensity is a measure of the total energy in the beam. If you increase the frequency, you increase the energy per photon, and thus need fewer photons to make up the same total energy. Fewer photons means fewer electrons.)

In half a century there is the real potential that controlling all essential renewable energy technology will net as much economic benefit as  having huge oil reserves did in the 20th century. Additionally, China does not have a large amount of hydrocarbons, meaning they have to rely on exports for energy, which is extremely dangerous in a conflict(think Axis powers WW2).

"Not just America but the new world in general. It's so easy to blame America but a lot of other places need to take responsibility too. We in Canada are really bad for this too.

The entirety of Western Canada is essentially a car only economy. Passenger train lines exist, but serve only tourist circuits in the west, and have to give scheduling priority to freight trains. (The one time I've ridden a western Canadian train, a trip scheduled for 22 hours become 42 because of freight train delays. Obviously this is not a practical option for anyone engaging in anything but leisure tourism)

 In my particular province, Saskatchewan, (which is very small, but still relevant) we have literally ZERO bus outside of cities. Our government defunded our already small public bus service, and this caused Greyhound (private contractor) to also completely withdraw from our market. This is in a place where it is possible to die of exposure (freeze to death) during 6 months of the year. It's essentially neo-feudalism. People without cars are literally welded to the land.

But what about planes? Well ignoring the economic cost (low cost carriers dont exist here really, Regina &gt; Calgary is the shortest route I'd feasibly fly and I dont think it ever goes below 400$) at least one of our two airports is totally inaccessible by foot: there is not even a city bus line going there. What are your options if you're just a normal person from some shitty circumstances who wants to get out of this repressive backwater? Literally selling yourself or hitchhiking (selling yourself with extra steps). 

I know I'm getting off track here, but Freedom of Movement within national borders is a UN mandated human rite. Not only are Western governments ignoring and imposing on that right: doing so actively worsens the climate crisis. It's a lose/lose game. A huge part of the problem in Canada and America is the false equivalence that ""car = freedom"" which is a message encouraged and pushed by governments and oil lobbies.

What makes this even worse: Western Canadian cars are actually specially modified with block heaters, and most people drive pick up trucks. It gets so cold here that in the winter people need to start their car 10-15 minutes in advance of driving for the engine to be able to run. A natural consequence of this is that it's also common for people to leave their car running for fairly long periods of time in the winter when they go into the store/are running errands etc. So not only do we use our cars more than (probably) anywhere else in the world, we also drive some of the worst vehicles and have some of the worst practices in terms of pollution.",Futurology

The same way whacking something with a hammer repeatedly gets you a lot more small pieces in the long run than bug ones, you end up with a lot more small chains than big ones, and the smaller chains are really only useful for fuel on a large scale. Plastics are really long chains, so to get them to the right length usually ends up with a lot more smaller pieces, and sticking things back together really isn't feasible in terms of cost.

"I would not refer to this as a phenomena. It's instead a direct and correlative relationship between urban insecurities with the recent bout of riots and civil unrest, as well as the exceptionally increased levels of quarantine measures that densely populated urban areas (i.e.: NYC, Bay Area) have implemented due to the recent pandemic originating in China.

Those who wish to escape these dangers to their livelihoods and well-being have literally fled the cities, which in-turn reduces occupancy rates, increases home property real estate listings, reduces demand to rent, and thus reduces rental price demands.

The only phenomena here are those who fail to recognize this trend, and/or deny these causes due their own cognitive dissonance.",Futurology

Never seen so many wildfires all along roadsides.  It's so weird how climate change starts all these fires along our road systems.  I wonder if maybe the asphault is getting too hot and catching the nearby leaves on fire.  It's the only thing that could explain that oddity.,Futurology
"they would likely only be significantly helpful with thousands of drones in the sky 24/7 - and their flight time is typically limited to an hour or two. Military drone fly much longer but also cost millions of dollars

tldr interesting concept but my hunch is it is unfeasible for millions of acres of land. most forest fires are caused by idiot people anyways, so often we are aware of them reasonably early.

As a surveillance measure they MIGHT be useful around urban or high traffic wilderness areas, but that introduces all sorts of safety, privacy and noise issues. 

Its possibly in the future if we developed better solar tech, better cameras, autonomous drone software and an AI to link and control hundreds of drones, this kind of thing could actually be done.

Oh one last thing: Forest fires are a natural and healthy part of the ecosystem life cycle. Old growth burns, creates room for new growth. We dont want to stop this process completely - simply protect nearby settlements and the people who live there",Futurology

"Thanks for the response. Here are some thoughts as I read through:
&gt;Climate change causes forest fuels (the organic matter that burns and spreads wildfire) to be more dry, and has doubled the number of large fires between 1984 and 2015 in the western United States.

This is blatantly poorly stated. The climate did not warm up enough to ignite anything. This should be stated as ""climate change made fire that have started be more difficult to contain and put out."" But the climate did not ignite anything. 1st paragraph.

Paragraph 2 clarified this, but logical readers would have turned off based on the lie in paragraph one. 

Later on in the article, it states that 2017 was abonormally bad, but that was also when california didn't do very much controlled burn. Those may be related, but I think the reason they didn't do controlled burn could be the uncontrolled burning happening. I would have to look at a calendar and a timeline to determine that. I mentioned the lack of burns in a different reply.

It mentions monetary damage, but that isn't a really good metric (note, it isn't a bad one, but it is easily distorted when talking climate change). Once you set a 100 story building on fire, the dollar value is taken as gospel, as in 1 acre you took out a billion dollar building, but that is irrelevant to climate change when you are referring to dry soil and things like that. granted, wind can help spread, but again, I think that stat goes back to and better with acreage.

The recommendations at the bottom of the article are worth discussion though:
&gt;Communities, builders, homeowners, and forest managers can reduce the likelihood and impacts of wildfires by:
&gt;Discouraging developments (especially residential) near fire-prone forests through smart zoning rules.
This seems smart. Don't build in high wind plane areas without natural water access.

&gt;Increasing the space between structures and nearby trees and brush, and clearing space between neighboring houses.
Encourages sprawl, which makes things worse?

&gt;Incorporating fire-resistant design features and materials in buildings.
Mandated by building code for a long... long... time (I am in construction)

&gt;Increasing resources allocated to firefighting and fire prevention.
Funding is always good.

&gt;Removing fuels, such as dead trees, from forests that are at risk.
This seems to be much more important. Removing the fuel stops the fire. Based on a previous reply, I think California is failing here.

&gt;Developing recovery plans before a fire hits, and implementing plans quickly after a fire to reduce erosion, limit flooding, and minimize habitat damage.
Good planning always helps.
Thanks for your response.",Futurology

Gasoline cars were originally completely mechanical devices, and with advent of electrical computers became more efficient and powerfull.

Seems to be saying if your heart rate is always 'up' even when sleeping that shows a correlation with depression.



If you're depressed it's hard to sleep and when you do sleep your dreams would likely relate to all the issues making you depressed which could dump some adrenaline while sleeping leading to less restful sleep which would make depression even more likely.

"Sadly there do not appear to be any summary sources (at least that showed up in a quick Google). You can read about the controversy surrounding Zenn to get some background. Then after that it's just catching scams as they pop up, over and over.

There are, for instance,  kickstarter pages constantly popping up, but most of them get taken down as scams by the crowdfunding companies, so they leave no lasting impression on the internet. There are webpages for these ultracap scams popping in and out of existence all the time, but unless they happen to get archived by a third party they also leave no lasting impression online. Easy come, easy go.

The best thing you can do on short notice is, I suppose, to read up about the differences between capacitors (of all types) and batteries, and why they're different. Wikipedia gives a good summary on them, and the listed sources at the bottom of the page make for good further reading. I'll do a short summary for you below to lay out the basics of why these types of scams are just as impossible as a free energy scam.
____
Basically, capacitors (*especially* ultracaps) have an exceptionally high power density, but an exceptionally low energy density the (I'll explain the difference in a moment). Batteries are the opposite, though modern lithium ion designs have an impressive (though still quite modest) power density to go along with their high energy density.

Power density is (basically) the speed at which you can charge and discharge an energy storage device. Energy density is the amount of energy it can store per unit of mass or volume. So power is speed, energy is amount. Capacitors are fast, batteries store a lot. Batteries are slow, capacitors store little.

Power density and energy density are (roughly, more or less) inversely proportional. As you increase one you decrease the other. You may be able to eventually very careful design a battery with a few times greater power density than current batteries, but there is a practical limit. You may be able to eventually design an ultracapacitor with a few times higher energy density, but the starting point of modern ultracaps is so low that that wouldn't really get you anywhere useful (at least not for mass storage).

As a rough, somewhat inaccurate analogy, imagine two tubs of water. One is very shallow, the other is very deep. You can fill the shallow one up very quickly, but you can't store much in it. You can store a lot in the deep one, but it can't be filled very quickly specifically because it is so deep. You can make the shallow one wider and wider to store more water, but eventually it grows to the size that it's cumbersome to use. You can make it much deeper instead, but then you're taking away the very thing that made it quick to fill compared to the deep tub: its shallowness.

Similarly, if you increase the energy density of an ultracapacitor enough to make it useful for large-scale energy storage, and you've kept its ""shallowness"" so that it's quick to fill, it's now obnoxiously large. Look at a Tesla grid storage megapack, then imagine it thousands of times bigger.

The other choice is to keep the size small but then sacrifice power density until the energy density gets up to an acceptable level. Congratulations, you've just invented the battery! At this point you've just created a much shittier, more expensive type of battery than a lithium ion battery - worse even than an old-school lead-acid battery.
____
That's the basic conundrum. Ultracapacitors are fast but shallow, batteries are deep but slow. You can use little design tricks to make each a bit better - in our water tub analogy you could taper the edges, for instance - but fundamentally the two technologies are good for opposite applications. 

Batteries work well for grid storage because you don't need massive amounts of power (but small amounts of energy) delivered or stored in a fraction of a second, instead you need a lot of energy stored over a long period of time (hours or days), then dribbled out to the grid as required.",Futurology
"Ideally industry will transition to hydrogen, leaving natural gas in the domestic space.

&gt; You were aware that the 2019/2020 Australian wildfires approximately doubled their CO2 emissions over the last year?

Year to year wildfire sizes fluctuate considerably.

For example, in the United States, in 2012, over 9 million acres were burned. In 2013, less than 4 million acres were burned. In 2014, that was down to just over 3 million acres burned.

According to your ""logic"", the size of wildfires in the US had decreased by over 60% in two years!

But in reality, this is fluctuation. 2015 saw 10 million acres of land burned.

There is an upward trend, but trying to use year to year data like this is completly wrong and no one with even the most basic level of background in statistics would do it.

The fact that you're making this error means that you don't really understand how to deal with data like this at all, and you should probably severely ramp down your confidence in your beliefs.

You can [manipulate](https://wildfiretoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Acres-burned-wildfire-US.jpg) the [trendline](https://wildfiretoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Acres-all-50-states-1986-2012.jpg) by arbitrarily picking different start and end dates.

&gt; One factor in the recent fires is almost certainly inadequate forest management, but it is far from the only factor.

I didn't say it was the only factor. I said it was a large factor.

It is a larger factor than global warming is.

But global warming is a factor as well.

Year to year fluctuations are caused by variations in climactic conditions.

&gt; Of the estimated eight million species on Earth, a million are now threatened with extinction, one expert warns.

These numbers are entirely made up.

There are 41,415 species on the IUCN redlist, of which 16,306 of them are endangered species threatened with extinction

https://www.endangeredearth.com/#:~:text=THE%20PLIGHT%20OF%20ENDANGERED%20SPECIES%3A,endangered%20animals%20and%20endangered%20plants.

People constantly fabricate numbers like these which have zero scientific basis.

&gt; Since 1970, vertebrate animals - birds, mammals, reptiles, fish and amphibians - have declined by 60%, another tells us.

This is also fabricated. I literally pointed this out elsewhere in the thread.

https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2018/11/animal-decline-living-planet-report-conservation-news/

It's an example of abuse of statistics.

That's not to say that the number of wild animals is not in decline - it is - but the number you're citing is flat-out false. It isn't what the number means.

As explained in the article:

&gt; Let‚Äôs say for example you have 50 tigers, 200 falcons, and 10,000 squirrels. Let‚Äôs say the first population declines by 90 percent, to 5 tigers. The second declines 80 percent, to 40 falcons. And the squirrels drop to 9,000‚Äîa 10 percent fall. That‚Äôs a 60 percent average decline of these three fictitious populations, but only a total decline of 12 percent of the individuals.

Again, you don't understand this stuff at all.

&gt; You seem stuck in an anti-malthusian mindset. A view that where, just because something has never happened before, then it can't possibly ever happen.

You are indistinguishable from the followers of Harold Camping.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Camping

Repeated failed prophecies, repeated scrambling to try and find another date for the apocaylpse and a new justification for it.

Repeated failure.

But you don't abandon it, because your belief in the apocalypse was never based on logic, it is based purely on faith.

This is why you're getting so upset at me - because I'm challenging your core belief in an upcoming apocalypse.

You need to accept that you've been indoctrinated into an apocalyptic cult, and get out of it.

The entire idea of a Malthusian catastrophe is completely false. It's not how reality works.

Here's how science works: you make a prediction, and you test it.

If your hypothesis repeatedly fails, it means you're wrong, and you need to abandon it.

This is precisely what has happened.

In real life, per capita agricultural productivity has been going up steadily because of improvements in technology.

Which is exactly what scientists predicted.

&gt; So we keep using fossil fuels? You might have missed the whole, IPCC project this path puts us on a 3C+ warming track. That is widely regarded as incompatible with organised human civilisation.

Nope. Only the cult members believe that global warming will end civilization.

There's no scientific basis for that belief whatsoever.

Indeed, the entire idea is *obviously* delusional.

Seriously. THINK.

Humans live in regions that differ by far more than 3 degrees centigrade in average annual temperature *right now*.

In fact, humans live in regions that differ by more than *20 degrees centigrade* in average annual temperature. People live in places like Anchorage, Alaska and Phoenix, Arizona.

The idea that three degrees centigrade of difference will cause global civilization to collapse is completely irrational.

It's not grounded in logic or reason, let alone science.

It's just delusion, pure and simple.

Seriously. Why would you believe this?

The answer is simple: indoctrination.",Futurology

&gt;It was a long 500-page   environmental assessment in which they tried to determine what the   environment would be like at the end of the century.

"I‚Äôm quite taken a back by the fact after everything I‚Äôve said you would assume I‚Äôm parroting a republican talking point. I‚Äôve been clear and critical of their shortcomings as well throughout our chat. 

My talking points are a direct reflection of firsthand experience. Years of experience seeing Sierra Club and others hold up proactive projects in the name of environmental protection.

I would never attest that the republicans are pro science. But the scientist, biologist etc I‚Äôve worked with (really starting to feel like a broken record having to repeat that) are as Democrats and tree huggers as you get, and they too are firmly on the side of more proactive management because they have seen it work, again, firsthand.

I‚Äôm sorry but I‚Äôm really frustrated by your insistence on telling me, you live in chaparral land, saying it can be ‚Äúraked‚Äù is I am in complete agreement a stupid statement. But chaparral can completely be managed and maintained similar to other fuel types. Again first hand experience with this on the Coronado NF.

The wall, military budget, racism and all that Jazz is a whole other discussion away from what we were focused on here I‚Äôd prefer not to get sidetracked. That said completely agree it‚Äôs a bullshit thing and we have plenty of money to put towards proactive management of our forests instead of useless border walls and feeding the MIC. But again that‚Äôs off track.

Also I think you have a very hateful look towards republicans. I wholeheartedly agree that many are absolutely bananaland stupid. But I‚Äôve worked with plenty who are passionate environmentalists they just prefer to act rather than sit back and watch beetle kill continue to burn everything to nothing.

I‚Äôve really enjoyed this discourse and civility but I think we have to just agree to disagree, although I truly don‚Äôt think we are that far off. I‚Äôve presented several proactive ideas, I‚Äôm all ears on hearing some from you, besides endlessly defending the SC( which again I support, but not on this issue) and blaming and hating republicans (again, I‚Äôm here for that on 99% of topics but not this one).",Futurology

"What you're saying is true for a closed system. But a house is not a closed system. There is a continuous heat exchange between inside and outside, and with a contained refrigeration gas that expands and contracts we can use the ideal gas law to our benefit. Now, it only works as long as the temperatures are within the the temperature range the refrigeration gas can operate at, but if it is we can move heat rather than create it. 

Take that example of yours, when moving heat from inside to outside the AC would pump gas from the interior pipes to the exterior pipes. This lowers the pressure of the interior refrigeration gas pipes and cools the gas in the interior pipes which in turn cools the room. In the exterior pipes on the other hand, the pressure rises and, by the ideal gas law, so does the heat and the pipes that heating up the outside. This is why the back of the refrigerator or freezer gets hot.

Gas price is currently too cheap to profit? Yes, but here is the thing. Flaring should be more expensive because of the damage to the environment.

Also, regulation of methane is absolutely needed because even if not the best, flaring is far better than letting the methane into the atmosphere.

While it is true the CPI used public opinion survey's prior to 2012, they stopped doing that and only used trusted experts to calculate their index ranking since 2012.

"Average incomes declined because the post war boom we had ended. After world war two europe was in ruins, and asia was barely developed. In the years right after the war the US alone accounted for fifty percent of global gdp. Fifty percent! Today we account for 15%. 

So that allowed us to build a massive middle class. The lower population helped too, because land was less desirable. That's why boomers could buy houses and put their kids through college on a factory workers pay. 

Trickle down is not and never was an actual economic theory espoused by any economist or even reagan himself. Seriously. Go try and find any economist using that term non pejoratively. You won't because no one did. 

&gt; The US stopped taxing the rich and corporations, so now the middle class or below gets to pay all the taxes.

That is not even close to being true. The top twenty percent of income earners in this country pay 87% of all federal income taxes. You want to take a guess what percentage the bottom fifty percent pay? 

&gt; Productivity, meanwhile, has gone up at least 6 times since then

Right. But increased productivity means fewer jobs almost by definition. Automation, offshoring manafacturing, and massive influxes of low skilled immigrants both legal and illegal was the final nail in the coffin.

Costs for technology have gone down by many orders of magnitude. Computers used to be $10,000. In fact, most consumer goods are much, much cheaper now thanks largely to offshoring manafacturing, and just in time supply chains. 

Now the middle class is growing in the developing world while its shrinking here. You could argue BECAUSE it's shrinking here.

Agree that it needs to be compared to similiar sized car haulers.  I'm seeing people throwing around numbers for fuel costs that compare this to a neopanamax, when that ship carries way more cargo, and different cargo.

It's definitely an interesting concept.  The trade winds help it out, but also mean it would have to go a longer way around then just back and forth across the atlantic.

The company can offer free updates, and people can judge a company for selling software locked tiers of performance. They are mutually exclusive. The 'correct' solution would be to 'average' the prices of all the tesla software features and change the minimum price of a tesla vehicle to incorporate that. Do customers want the freedom of a cheaper Tesla by not paying for features they don't want? Or would they rather everyone be forced to pay for features they may not need so that those that want the feature can pay less? This also could help people enjoy features they wouldn't have paid for otherwise, who may then end up enjoying the car even more.

"There have been instances of people who were blinded as children recovering sight as adults. They are still effectively blind in many ways because their brain cannot process visual information. They have difficulty recognizing familiar people and objects. Being able to visually scan and then explore your environment, for example, is necessary to form depth perception, which is just one component of vision. If you're unable to do that during formative years, then, yes, you will lose the ability to do so later on. If you put a child in a dark room alone during their formative years, you will effectively blind them even if nothing was originally wrong with their eyes or brain. If you dont use it during development, you lose it.

What ultimately happens is that the person has vision but the brain can't process it. We see this in children with cortical visual impairments (vision loss resulting from an issue with the brain, not an issue with the eyes itself). You really have a small portion of time to build the neurons that enable meaningful sight, which is why we do so many interventions just to get them to intentionally gaze at a target. This gets much more difficult as the individual gets older and their brain is less able to form the connections needed.

"Not a surprise. Automation means taking skills that required humans and putting them into the cheaper machines, so you can hire less skilled people to do the same job. And less skilled people get paid less. This has pretty much been the model for automation since the spinning jenny.

"&gt;**Within industries adopting automation**, the study shows, the average ‚Äúdisplacement‚Äù (or job loss) from 1947-1987 was 17 percent of jobs, while the average ‚Äúreinstatement‚Äù (new opportunities) was 19 percent. But from 1987-2016, displacement was 16 percent, while reinstatement was just 10 percent. In short, those factory positions or phone-answering jobs are not coming back.

First of all, why are they only looking at industries adopting automation? Why wouldn‚Äôt new jobs in industries not adoption automation matter at all? 

Second, it doesn‚Äôt seem clear how they accounted for changes due to international economic growth. I don‚Äôt like when studies claim automation is reducing the number of jobs... but that‚Äôs just isn‚Äôt true most of the world. The number of jobs (non agricultural) in the world has actually dramatically increased by literally *billions* since 1987. All of their factories have implemented levels of automation, it‚Äôs got they stay competitive with the rest of the world

This claim is only true if you look at the US.  But since the global economy has drastically changed so much over the last 40 years, I find it hard to believe it‚Äôs not the driving factor, far far more than automation. The US isn‚Äôt the only extremely productive country in the world anymore, Americans are competing against billions of people for work these days. And since they didn‚Äôt address this in the article about their study, I find it very frustrating that they are making such strong claims when they are completely ignoring other major factors. This is why the social sciences are more difficult to study, you can‚Äôt isolate these systems from dozens or hundreds of different important factors.",Futurology

Note that it says ""natural"". Not the outlying mass extinctions I'm talking about that which life obviously survived through.

Can the batteries be recycled/reused, how efficient are they after being refurbished. And more importantly, how do you dispose of said batteries given the volume of dead batteries that will be produced and the fact that they are hazardous waste and have to be disposed of such.

"This is a very important question and it is vital that people know the answer.  
  
Solar-panels make sense when you are putting them on already-existing man-made structures, e.g. on top of buildings.  
  
But what you suggest, a coop buying land, is egregious environmental damage because thee most precious resources is habitat. Solar-panels also produce waste of an as-of-yet unknown toxicity. The environmental consequences of the nano-particles are not known.  
  
For wind-mills the environmental damage is know as they produce an astounding 36 tonnes of hazardous fiber-glass waste every 10 to 12 years because the blade-assemblies wear-out on-top-of their egregious land use. The notion of putting them in the water is an *even worse* idea as 11/12^th of the shallow ocean habitat has already been destroyed.  
  
A roll-out of solar and/or wind to furfill baseload and peak would be an environmental catastrophe destroying more of what little habitat remains. Solar and wind **ARE NOT SOLUTIONS**. They cause more damage.  
  
The best course of action is nuclear for baseload and natural-gas for peak. Natural-gas burns 4x clearner than oil or coal - that is a **massive** improvement. The thorium decay chain is preferred but failing that then uranium it is. This needs to hold us over until fusion-power is commercialized.

What about patents? Too many are sitting on patents for VAWTs, more efficient panels and other tech that could generate power from home waste (septic gases, water use-impeller, ...).

In the US, certain state and county regulations do not want ""individuals"" to be independent of their taxing utilities.

"That's an absolute straw man of an argument. No one is advocating lower housing costs because it is fair and they have a right. What they are advocating for is that housing costs reflect market values and aren't dictated by forces with zero oversight or limitations. Keep in mind how bad it is for the economy to have a stifled housing market. For one, we have foreign investors who literally just buy up property and let it sit because it is a way to keep equity and wealth out of the hands of their respective governments (looking at you China.) When that happens the house becomes dead weight on the economy because there is no flow of capital apart from property taxes. It would be an entirely different argument if they were rental properties but they are not. That is just one problem, the other is when you have massive rental corporations buying up entire tracts of housing for the sake of a monopoly. In a free market if you were renting from someone and they exorbitantly hiked up your rental prices, you could give them the finger and find a better deal. But when that company owns every home in the area, there is no competition and they have created a monopolistic feedback loop allowing them to charge whatever they want because there is no alternative.

You keep saying that it lies solely with personal responsibility when it doesn't. Yes people can be smarter with their money, but that doesn't excuse the obvious manipulation of the market.

1. The damage they can cause if they are not maintained overtime eg: budget cuts

2. Target for terrorists attacks or bombing ( eg: poor nations where defense of these structures may not be guaranteed over 50 years )

4.  Storage of waste, why make something so hard to deal with in the first place?

5. The Limited supply. If we completely transition to this we have say 200 years of fuel assuming the population keeps growing.

So you will have to unpack your statement a little more clearly with references ideally.

You also haven't done your calculations on the potential of EV storage. Say you have an ev runabout car. You can tell your car that you need only 20 miles range on any one day  so that leaves 95% of that cars battery free for storage. If half of all cars are like this then it still supplies a massive amount of strorage - given most countries are switch to all ev's by 2035. Due to a potential pay back scheme and the low degradation of modern batteries EV owners are keen to implement this scheme.

Another simple way around it is to over supply wind and solar so that the country is usually at 100% renewables and if some strange drop of wind occurs you may have to switch a lot of gas power back on - but still over the year you are at 80% or above renewables. 

Another way I believe you are incorrect is the recent incredibly low price of electricity storage means that wind plus storage looks to be about the same price as levelised gas costs.

My company has recently announced plans to invest in a dedicated recycling program to turn waste plastic back into feedstock for new plastic.  There is a long way to go in reducing the carbon footprint of the industry, but a complete abandonment of plastic products is not entirely feasible right now.

Biodegradable hemp plastics, and other natural materials, can have their place in some applications, but I doubt anyone wants their car, household appliances, or other objects rotting out from under them.

"Environmental scientist here. Primitivism and degrowth cannot physically solve climate change. It's bizarre that so many of my colleagues have such a huge blind spot on this issue and make this error so often. These are ideologically-driven, not evidence based.

Although the details are debated, it seems likely that as long as CO2 concentration is above natural equilibrium of around 280ppm, we will have continued climate change impacts including melting ice sheets and sea level rise. 

This ""inertia"" in the system means that even if all new GHG emissions dropped to zero tomorrow, we would still have catastrophic impacts from climate change due to the &gt;400ppm CO2 already in the atmosphere. Since it would take at least decades and maybe centuries for natural equilibrium ppm to be restored, climate change is still a huge problem for many decades *even if all humans disappeared tomorrow*.

Lifestyle changes that reduce emissions by reducing consumption don't pull even a single gram of CO2 out of the atmosphere. So they are not a real solution for climate change. Planting trees is of course a good idea, but it cannot sequester enough carbon to fully return us to 280ppm.

It is far too late to solve climate change with primitivism and austerity.

Our only chance to really prevent climate change impacts now is gigantic global CO2 withdrawal megaprojects. We need to take 500+ gigatons of carbon out of the atmosphere within two or three decades, or we will still face catastrophic impacts.

We can't do those megaprojects by destroying the global economy and returning to the trees. Our only chance now is to maintain a thriving economy and focus on technological engineering solutions. The opportunity to solve climate change with social changes alone expired 10-20 years ago.",Futurology
"But that argument can be extended to all humans.  Always blame someone else.  Blame those before you. Those older than you.  Those of a differing skin colour.  It's always someone else's fault.  It's so easy to shift blame instead of innovating and engineering solutions that bring real change. 

I like that these kids are trying to bring change. But they're unloading the creativity and ingenuity needed for that change onto someone else.  

Suing other countries is great. But what do you expect them to do?   With what solutions? Funded by who's money?  Impacting the citizens and children of those countries as well no doubt.  

The easiest thing in the world is to speak up, but it usually doesn't go any farther than that.

And [we've had a stable amount of children globally since like 2002](https://population.un.org/wpp/Graphs/DemographicProfiles/Line/900).

I have a feeling that people that don't trust public companies often just don't understand how they work, and worse yet, they pass on that ignorance to anyone that will listen, further weakening the voice of the individual american.

"If only they could stop cities dropping out of the project once they looked into the finances behind it.

Nuscale abandoned their produce SMRs in a factory to save costs, and will rely on traditional supply chains.

https://losalamosreporter.com/2020/08/22/get-out-of-the-fluor-nuscale-small-modular-reactor-project/

&gt; the plan to save costs by fabricating the modules at a remote factory and shipping them to the Idaho site has been abandoned. The artful response to my question said that Nuscale engaged with approximately 40 ‚Ä¶ pressure vessel fabricators worldwide and ‚Ä¶ determined that Nuscale will use existing factories ‚Ä¶ in lieu of building its own factory.

&gt;The major module subcomponents will be manufactured at multiple manufacturer locations and shipped to a single location for assembly prior to installing into the facility.‚Äù This signifies the failure of one of the major cost-saving features of the Nuscale project, which was to forestall this exact scenario.

Very few cities have joined the project, and they are already dropping out

&gt;The Fluor/Nuscale scheme to finance the development of this reactor by enlisting many small municipal utilities to subscribe to the power is only about 30% subscribed, and two municipalities recently dropped out while one new one opted in.

If it does not get over a billion in subsidies, they will look at cancelling it entirely.

https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy/nuclear-advocates-fret-as-first-maker-of-small-reactors-encounters-trouble

&gt; UAMPS, as the coalition is known, could still abandon the project altogether. It is planning to convene in mid-September to approve a budget and could decide then to quit. The group says it is in negotiations with the Energy Department for the federal government to provide a $1.4 billion grant, which the utilities say they need to defray the rising cost of buying nuclear power.

It is already exploding in cost, in the normal tradition of nuclear projects.

&gt; Earlier this month, the Utah Taxpayer Association called on cities to withdraw from the project ahead of the Sept. 14 deadline after a closed-door virtual town hall meeting on July 21 where officials warned of project delays, increased costs to cities and towns involved, and ‚Äúdependence on unpredictable federal subsidies.‚Äù

&gt; ‚ÄúThe UAMPS project will lock in 27 municipalities in Utah and several in surrounding states for a share of billions of dollars in costs and unclear risk in the pursuit of a cluster of small modular reactors (SMRs) touted by Oregon-based NuScale Power, which repeatedly has delayed timelines and increased costs associated with its SMRs,‚Äù Utah Taxpayer Association Vice President Rusty Cannon said in an Aug. 4 news release. ‚ÄúThe risky project with massive cost escalations is being conducted largely out of the public eye.‚Äù

"Yes, of course but very few people recycle their cell phones (less than 20% of unwanted cellphones are recycled each year according to the EPA) and because we aren't currently getting those resources back we need to be more mindful of how we use the resources that are available so that we don't have a shortage or run out completly. Also when people are done with a cell phone and throw it away improperly, their are numerous toxic chemicals released into the environment. If we made cell phones last longer there would be fewer thrown away and therefore our environment would be much cleaner and much safer.",Futurology
"So that brings me back to my original question. You got a better idea? I'm being serious. Maybe 20 years ago, we had enough time that we could have taken a more gradual, moderate approach to the climate crisis. But we're out of time. I am convinced the only possible way to save the planet in time to preserve life on earth is revolution. Not saying it's guaranteed to work, or even that it's likely to work. But what other choice do we have?",Futurology
"We need weaponized drones to destroy those illegal drones near airports. Those are expensive toys, so it will definitely make the irresponsible owners think twice before violating controlled airspace.",Futurology

A jetpack at 3000 feet makes even less sense,Futurology
"This attitude is so depressing. People complain about big companies not doing enough, then when they start huge initiatives that will requires thousands of people to spend years to achieve and people still complain it‚Äôs not happening fast enough.

Even if they‚Äôre doing it to be profitable, why is that a problem? They‚Äôre still doing the right thing. So many people complain about how capitalism incentivizes bad behavior but when it drives good behavior like this people complain about the fact that companies are doing it for profit.",Futurology
"oh, yea for sure.  A drone doing a purposeful hoax seems like the most likely thing.

Just so weird.  Especially since whoever flew it could be in some serious trouble if they came forward.  

A UFO hoax would have been much cooler and much more worth the effort",Futurology
That‚Äôs really disappointing.,Futurology
How would you mistake that for a jet pack?,Futurology
"While I also do as much as I personally can (including eating less meat), the real solution is ‚Äústronger together‚Äù, but as in voting for politicians that believe in climate change and are willing to do something about it. Individual action isn‚Äôt sufficient in the face of overwhelming industrial inaction. In fact, no amount of reduction will save us at this point, we must both reduce and industrially remove CO2 that past generations have emitted. 

The economy is broken and will need to be fixed. The fix must including serious greening, or it‚Äôs no fix at all. I predict that many will declare the economy an emergency, and say that we can‚Äôt address climate change until it is better.  But there is no better time than when the world is in tatters to rebuild it greener and more equitably.",Futurology

"&gt; . . and are among the biggest donators to charity in the world.

The Catholic Church spreads poverty and misery wherever they have a foothold due to the stance on birth control, lbgtq rights, misogyny and the active support of pedophiles to name a few. That they donate pennies on the dollars to appear to rectify some of the wrongs they are largely responsible for (I‚Äôm referring to poverty and low education levels due to their demand that families churn out more and more victims for the church) deserves no praise.

&gt;Anyone who thinks we'd be better off without the church is actually pretty ignorant.

We would be much better off if people were actually connected with reality instead of deluding themselves with the woo woo pushed by the church.",Futurology

"How so?  3000 feet is perfectly survivable and typically only about 9 degrees colder than what the surface temp would be.  The tech exists, jetpacks are capable of flight at that altitude above sea level.  

I mean, flying in a published approach path in likely Class B airspace without a radio and ATC approval makes no sense.  But flying at 3000 feet with a jetpack doesn't seem far fetched by itself.",Futurology
No but it starts at common sense. If it is not safe to deliver food to cities because of rioting then you will see some desperate people do some desperate things. Then the guns come out etc. Beginning of war.,Futurology
