2,baumannsw,t2_ikzgr,"&gt;Lockdowns were a huge mistake.

Half-assed lockdowns are a mistake.  Which is what the US did.  We never had a lockdown, we had a ""well, let's try to closed down a couple places and see what happens"".

The results from Italy's arguably draconian lockdown were undeniably real.  

&gt;For example 80% of deaths are attributed to nursing homes and other individuals that wouldn't have survived the year anyways

Got a source for this? Just because you are in a nursing home doesn't mean you are not going to survive the year.  

NY had to resort to moving elderly from hospitals to nursing homes because the hospitals were at capacity. It was a shitty  no-win situation.  What would you have done if the hospitals were full and new patients kept coming in?  Keep the elderly and deny new patients?",1600609164,g5z7ehz,t1_g5xpcct,/r/Futurology/comments/iw1bb7/coronavirus_responses_highlight_how_humans_have/g5z7ehz/,1,Futurology,comment

21,twisted-oak,t2_i18ua,"I'm arguing against the point you did take. I just applied it rhetorically to ""any issue you could ask about"" to illustrate what a ridiculous assumption it was that you made. It would be equally ridiculous to say ""well I'm sure they thought that"" as an answer to ANY engineering question, that was my point. It's a thought terminating non answer that detracts from the discussion of people actual trying to talk about the engineering problems 

&gt; And that false claim I made doesn't diminish my point in any way, it was tangential. Also, I forgot. I knew that, but forgot. That happens. Still, doesn't impact my argument.

It really does impact your argument and diminish your point, entirely. Why else would you delete it? Your only comment that said anything substantive or falsifiable, and you erase it after its easily proven false. When your whole initial point was ""I am willing to bet they thought of it"" and people ask why, and you give the reasons... 

That's not a tangent. That's called supporting your point with evidence. And when your evidence failed for being factually wrong, you deleted it and said ""ahh it was just an irrelevant tangent""

&gt; you really think they didn't have someone think ""what if something breaks down inside the tunnel?""

This is an appeal to incredulity. It doesn't matter how dumb you make it sound, people make mistakes all the time, and its valid to discuss that possibility. The burden of proof is on you, my dude. Show us the evidence of why you think they DID necessarily think of it already.

Suppose you take all this essentially dead (not circulating) money and redistribute it.

People see it as some kind of virtual panacea, yet it is but a mirage. Real wealth in a nation is not its currency, but rather the goods and services produced by its collective citizens.

And the greatest irony? Those that are the biggest proponents of taxation to solve this inequality problem are usually the same people that are okay with deficit spending and money creation that led to this situation in the first place. Almost all new money created is ending up at the top. When beloved liberal governments around the world print money like mad, they do so full well knowing it will all end up at the top.

We can create lasers which place these photons in a coherent relationship as predicted by theory. 



Your position that it does not really exist seems quite at odds with reality. 
 Each of these three confirmations means that in reality a photon exists. Simply because you cannot put it between your teeth and crack it like  a walnut does not mean it does not exist.

Eventually they stopped, presumably because they are out of business and/or Cow poo. And the few left over started rumours saying clean coal is ""less hot"" or ""poisonous"".

312,straightsally,t2_g01tm,"You are completely wrong. Einstein's explanation has been completely verified experimentally by Robert Millikan who spent ten years trying to disprove the Law of the photoelectric effect. He confirmed Einstein's theory in **EVERY DETAIL**   He did publish his results although he was unhappy about them. Your pathetic attempt is pure nonsense.

 A photon does not exist and cannot be detected? I suggest you read up on the Compton effect which absolutely proves that it does. 
 Over and over again Einstein's work has been verified experimentally.
 The photon anti-bunching effect is another experiment that shows photons exist. These three things kick your claim of no such thing as a photon right in the balls. I can just see you bent over clutching your crotch right now.

BTW Einstein dealt with the emission of electrons and he was responsible for classification of the duality of light waves and particles (photons) which no one had done before. It was his insight of light as particles that led to a major contribution in quantum mechanics. 

 &gt;I will not find a single highly regarded physicist that claims photons are real. 

How about Einstein himself? Or https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03280 (Hope you have a subscription.) He is more highly acclaimed than anyone you can cite to the contrary. 

https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Challenge-Second-Foundations-Mechanics/dp/076372470X/ Here is some *light* reading about the reality of photons.

Classical theory cannot explain the six experimental results found in the area of research.  Only one of them.  Einstein's theory does explain them all.. 


The number of electrons emitted increases as you increase the intensity of the light. (Higher intensity means more total energy, which means more photons. More photons means more electrons knocked loose.)

The energy of the electrons emitted does not depend on the intensity at all. (The electron energy is whatever's left of a single photon energy after you supply the energy needed for the work function. The total number of photons has nothing to do with it.)

As you vary the frequency of the light, you find that there is a frequency below which no electrons are emitted, no matter how high an intensity you use. (If the photon energy is less than the energy required to free an electron, it doesn't matter how many photons you throw at the system, nothing's going to happen.)

Above the cutoff frequency, the energy of the electrons emitted increases linearly as you increase the frequency. (The higher the frequency, the higher the photon energy, and the higher the photon energy, the more energy is left for the electron.)

There's no time delay. No matter how low you make the intensity, if electrons are emitted at all, they come out instantly. (One photon is all it takes. You don't need to build up energy slowly.)

If you keep a constant intensity, and vary the frequency, you find fewer electrons coming out at higher frequencies. (Intensity is a measure of the total energy in the beam. If you increase the frequency, you increase the energy per photon, and thus need fewer photons to make up the same total energy. Fewer photons means fewer electrons.)

The first incident is indeed the only one who was important but it was an older model decommissionned in the 90's (not one of the 56 reactors I mentioned) and it didn't cause any damage.

This is always the problem with nuclear power, there are lots of opposition and no vocal support, so anti-nuclear movement always use false arguments nobody will bother to contradict. It's the same tactics for long term storage, Greenpeace systematically opposes solutions so they can say ""there's no long term storage solution"" until it becomes ingrained in people's mind.

Look up the power plant of the first incident, its only two Wikipedia contents are ""incidents"" and ""flood risk"". When you look at the source for the flood risk, the article states the plant didn't build a wall ""maybe"" because it was expensive and the only person they interviewed is a member of the ""Get out of nuclear movement"" who says the plant is indeed dangerous (what a surprise).

421,IronScheherazade,t2_bwu0b,"Not just America but the new world in general. It's so easy to blame America but a lot of other places need to take responsibility too. We in Canada are really bad for this too.

The entirety of Western Canada is essentially a car only economy. Passenger train lines exist, but serve only tourist circuits in the west, and have to give scheduling priority to freight trains. (The one time I've ridden a western Canadian train, a trip scheduled for 22 hours become 42 because of freight train delays. Obviously this is not a practical option for anyone engaging in anything but leisure tourism)

 In my particular province, Saskatchewan, (which is very small, but still relevant) we have literally ZERO bus outside of cities. Our government defunded our already small public bus service, and this caused Greyhound (private contractor) to also completely withdraw from our market. This is in a place where it is possible to die of exposure (freeze to death) during 6 months of the year. It's essentially neo-feudalism. People without cars are literally welded to the land.

But what about planes? Well ignoring the economic cost (low cost carriers dont exist here really, Regina &gt; Calgary is the shortest route I'd feasibly fly and I dont think it ever goes below 400$) at least one of our two airports is totally inaccessible by foot: there is not even a city bus line going there. What are your options if you're just a normal person from some shitty circumstances who wants to get out of this repressive backwater? Literally selling yourself or hitchhiking (selling yourself with extra steps). 

I know I'm getting off track here, but Freedom of Movement within national borders is a UN mandated human rite. Not only are Western governments ignoring and imposing on that right: doing so actively worsens the climate crisis. It's a lose/lose game. A huge part of the problem in Canada and America is the false equivalence that ""car = freedom"" which is a message encouraged and pushed by governments and oil lobbies.

What makes this even worse: Western Canadian cars are actually specially modified with block heaters, and most people drive pick up trucks. It gets so cold here that in the winter people need to start their car 10-15 minutes in advance of driving for the engine to be able to run. A natural consequence of this is that it's also common for people to leave their car running for fairly long periods of time in the winter when they go into the store/are running errands etc. So not only do we use our cars more than (probably) anywhere else in the world, we also drive some of the worst vehicles and have some of the worst practices in terms of pollution.",1600264068,g5gxwwm,t1_g5gfddc,/r/Futurology/comments/itn5ez/oil_demand_has_collapsed_and_it_wont_come_back/g5gxwwm/,13,Futurology,comment

If you are being attacked by a guy with a knife and you have another guy standing next to him doing nothing, what's the end result? Yeah the guy with the knife is the bad one but does that mean the guy doing nothing is a saint? No because you still end up getting stabbed.

&gt;Democrats: put forth environmental protections in last administration and currently have a plan to help the environment that may do nothing. 

Except their entire ""help the environment"" is lip service. They haven't addressed any actual palpable solutions. 

&gt;I realize that my condescension is likely to make you dig in a bit here, but really, please, come on. Even if democrats do nothing, they are better than the GOP who is actively making it easier for companies to fuck the planet up.

See my first example.

&gt; How is it not clear to you that the GOP is worse for the planet than the Democrats?

Getting shot in the head versus bleeding out slowly still ends up with you being dead. Maybe we can instead push for actual policy instead of the standard Democrat idea of ""do nothing but make it sound like a lot.""

&gt;I'm a moderate centrist who's smarter than everyone else"" circle-jerk.

Pretty sure I'm not the one being smug here. 

&gt;Unfortunately, the moderate centrists' positions are also 100% academic BECAUSE YOU ONLY HAVE 2 CHOICES IN NOVEMBER OF THIS YEAR. Get the right party in, and then push for electoral reform. I promise you, you will not get a more robust democracy, which would enable you to feasibly elect your third party, out of the GOP. It's unlikely you get it from the democrats either, but you've got a better shot, and you've gotta start somewhere. 


Who said I was voting Republican?

447,mikamitcha,t2_pvfbd,"With how oil is processed, much more gasoline and lighter fuels are produced per every unit of plastic. Basically, oil production is taking crude oil, which has a huge web of carbon chains, and breaking those down using steam and then sorting out the pieces. The same way whacking something with a hammer repeatedly gets you a lot more small pieces in the long run than bug ones, you end up with a lot more small chains than big ones, and the smaller chains are really only useful for fuel on a large scale. Plastics are really long chains, so to get them to the right length usually ends up with a lot more smaller pieces, and sticking things back together really isn't feasible in terms of cost.

Now, this ignores a ton of other variables, but it's a vague explanation of why oil is not feasible as a resource without fuel being consumed.",1600264639,g5gyx3f,t1_g5g0nss,/r/Futurology/comments/itn5ez/oil_demand_has_collapsed_and_it_wont_come_back/g5gyx3f/,3,Futurology,comment

It's instead a direct and correlative relationship between urban insecurities with the recent bout of riots and civil unrest, as well as the exceptionally increased levels of quarantine measures that densely populated urban areas (i.e.: NYC, Bay Area) have implemented due to the recent pandemic originating in China.

Those who wish to escape these dangers to their livelihoods and well-being have literally fled the cities, which in-turn reduces occupancy rates, increases home property real estate listings, reduces demand to rent, and thus reduces rental price demands.

549,hopeunseen,t2_14vcrm0x,"they would likely only be significantly helpful with thousands of drones in the sky 24/7 - and their flight time is typically limited to an hour or two. Military drone fly much longer but also cost millions of dollars

tldr interesting concept but my hunch is it is unfeasible for millions of acres of land. most forest fires are caused by idiot people anyways, so often we are aware of them reasonably early.

As a surveillance measure they MIGHT be useful around urban or high traffic wilderness areas, but that introduces all sorts of safety, privacy and noise issues. 

Its possibly in the future if we developed better solar tech, better cameras, autonomous drone software and an AI to link and control hundreds of drones, this kind of thing could actually be done.

552,smooshiebear,t2_15syp9oc,"Thanks for the response. Here are some thoughts as I read through:
&gt;Climate change causes forest fuels (the organic matter that burns and spreads wildfire) to be more dry, and has doubled the number of large fires between 1984 and 2015 in the western United States.

This is blatantly poorly stated. The climate did not warm up enough to ignite anything. This should be stated as ""climate change made fire that have started be more difficult to contain and put out."" But the climate did not ignite anything. 1st paragraph.

Paragraph 2 clarified this, but logical readers would have turned off based on the lie in paragraph one. 

Later on in the article, it states that 2017 was abonormally bad, but that was also when california didn't do very much controlled burn. Those may be related, but I think the reason they didn't do controlled burn could be the uncontrolled burning happening. I would have to look at a calendar and a timeline to determine that. I mentioned the lack of burns in a different reply.

It mentions monetary damage, but that isn't a really good metric (note, it isn't a bad one, but it is easily distorted when talking climate change). Once you set a 100 story building on fire, the dollar value is taken as gospel, as in 1 acre you took out a billion dollar building, but that is irrelevant to climate change when you are referring to dry soil and things like that. granted, wind can help spread, but again, I think that stat goes back to and better with acreage.

The recommendations at the bottom of the article are worth discussion though:
&gt;Communities, builders, homeowners, and forest managers can reduce the likelihood and impacts of wildfires by:
&gt;Discouraging developments (especially residential) near fire-prone forests through smart zoning rules.
This seems smart. Don't build in high wind plane areas without natural water access.

&gt;Increasing the space between structures and nearby trees and brush, and clearing space between neighboring houses.
Encourages sprawl, which makes things worse?

&gt;Incorporating fire-resistant design features and materials in buildings.
Mandated by building code for a long... long... time (I am in construction)

&gt;Increasing resources allocated to firefighting and fire prevention.
Funding is always good.

&gt;Removing fuels, such as dead trees, from forests that are at risk.
This seems to be much more important. Removing the fuel stops the fire. Based on a previous reply, I think California is failing here.

&gt;Developing recovery plans before a fire hits, and implementing plans quickly after a fire to reduce erosion, limit flooding, and minimize habitat damage.
Good planning always helps.
Thanks for your response.",1600177655,g5crvld,t1_g5cpqmo,/r/Futurology/comments/it3c23/the_climate_refugees_are_here_theyre_americans/g5crvld/,-2,Futurology,comment

In other words, this news is exciting whether we actually confirm life or not. It just so happens that Occam’s Razor, given what we currently understand about phosphine from a well studied field, points to this being evidence of life.

665,DragonWhsiperer,t2_1245rk,"I'm no expert, but (and then follows some edge case rambling) looking at how modern electric cars are made, I highly doubt we could have mass produced these all electric cars early 1900 at any scale and reliability that we see from gasoline cars. The power balance of the battery and motor needs would be impractical with the tech of that day. Back in 1900 all kinds of fuels were thought up as mediums for cars.

Gasoline cars were originally completely mechanical devices, and with advent of electrical computers became more efficient and powerfull.
Press the gas pedal more, more fuel injected that makes it go faster, and mechanically linked valve timing follows directly.

Has big oil stiffled development after WW2? possible. For aviation however it is simply the case that kerosine had incredible power density, and there even today no practical substitute exists.

I think fossil fuels are simply a stepping stone required to reach the cleaner fuels.

&gt;Typically, explained Schiweck, ""Heart rates are higher during the day and lower at night."" Interestingly, he added, it appears that the decrease in the heart right at night is ""impaired in depression."" This change seems to be a new way of determining if a patient is at risk to develop depression or deteriorate. 

Seems to be saying if your heart rate is always 'up' even when sleeping that shows a correlation with depression.



If you're depressed it's hard to sleep and when you do sleep your dreams would likely relate to all the issues making you depressed which could dump some adrenaline while sleeping leading to less restful sleep which would make depression even more likely.

But even if it is depression causing the elevated heart rates, it's good to have a quantifiable measurement for depression.",1600093053,g58czad,t3_isk6ga,/r/Futurology/comments/isk6ga/your_depression_risk_can_be_measured_by_the/g58czad/,5,Futurology,comment

However, I THINK this may be a sign that this particular wealth management corporation understands that that they won’t continue to be profitable if the planet dies and takes humans with it.  Also, could just be a tactic to try to sustain their profit-schemes in anticipation of a shifting public (ie end consumers) demand for “green” products, instead of supporting actual green economies (where they don’t think they’d make as much money).  Either way isn’t “bad” per-se, but may stand in the way of the green solutions we need to actually save the planet from the (current/ongoing) climate disaster.

718,gopher65,t2_hzlsj,"Sadly there do not appear to be any summary sources (at least that showed up in a quick Google). You can read about the controversy surrounding Zenn to get some background. Then after that it's just catching scams as they pop up, over and over.

There are, for instance,  kickstarter pages constantly popping up, but most of them get taken down as scams by the crowdfunding companies, so they leave no lasting impression on the internet. There are webpages for these ultracap scams popping in and out of existence all the time, but unless they happen to get archived by a third party they also leave no lasting impression online. Easy come, easy go.

The best thing you can do on short notice is, I suppose, to read up about the differences between capacitors (of all types) and batteries, and why they're different. Wikipedia gives a good summary on them, and the listed sources at the bottom of the page make for good further reading. I'll do a short summary for you below to lay out the basics of why these types of scams are just as impossible as a free energy scam.
____
Basically, capacitors (*especially* ultracaps) have an exceptionally high power density, but an exceptionally low energy density the (I'll explain the difference in a moment). Batteries are the opposite, though modern lithium ion designs have an impressive (though still quite modest) power density to go along with their high energy density.

Power density is (basically) the speed at which you can charge and discharge an energy storage device. Energy density is the amount of energy it can store per unit of mass or volume. So power is speed, energy is amount. Capacitors are fast, batteries store a lot. Batteries are slow, capacitors store little.

Power density and energy density are (roughly, more or less) inversely proportional. As you increase one you decrease the other. You may be able to eventually very careful design a battery with a few times greater power density than current batteries, but there is a practical limit. You may be able to eventually design an ultracapacitor with a few times higher energy density, but the starting point of modern ultracaps is so low that that wouldn't really get you anywhere useful (at least not for mass storage).

As a rough, somewhat inaccurate analogy, imagine two tubs of water. One is very shallow, the other is very deep. You can fill the shallow one up very quickly, but you can't store much in it. You can store a lot in the deep one, but it can't be filled very quickly specifically because it is so deep. You can make the shallow one wider and wider to store more water, but eventually it grows to the size that it's cumbersome to use. You can make it much deeper instead, but then you're taking away the very thing that made it quick to fill compared to the deep tub: its shallowness.

Similarly, if you increase the energy density of an ultracapacitor enough to make it useful for large-scale energy storage, and you've kept its ""shallowness"" so that it's quick to fill, it's now obnoxiously large. Look at a Tesla grid storage megapack, then imagine it thousands of times bigger.

The other choice is to keep the size small but then sacrifice power density until the energy density gets up to an acceptable level. Congratulations, you've just invented the battery! At this point you've just created a much shittier, more expensive type of battery than a lithium ion battery - worse even than an old-school lead-acid battery.
____
That's the basic conundrum. Ultracapacitors are fast but shallow, batteries are deep but slow. You can use little design tricks to make each a bit better - in our water tub analogy you could taper the edges, for instance - but fundamentally the two technologies are good for opposite applications. 

Batteries work well for grid storage because you don't need massive amounts of power (but small amounts of energy) delivered or stored in a fraction of a second, instead you need a lot of energy stored over a long period of time (hours or days), then dribbled out to the grid as required.",1600005108,g53zcg9,t1_g53i4lf,/r/Futurology/comments/inx50v/microgrids_are_the_future_of_energy_the_vision_of/g53zcg9/,1,Futurology,comment

https://xkcd.com/605/

Read this.

This is what you're doing when you say things like this:

&gt; You were aware that the 2019/2020 Australian wildfires approximately doubled their CO2 emissions over the last year?

Year to year wildfire sizes fluctuate considerably.

For example, in the United States, in 2012, over 9 million acres were burned. In 2013, less than 4 million acres were burned. In 2014, that was down to just over 3 million acres burned.

According to your ""logic"", the size of wildfires in the US had decreased by over 60% in two years!

But in reality, this is fluctuation. 2015 saw 10 million acres of land burned.

There is an upward trend, but trying to use year to year data like this is completly wrong and no one with even the most basic level of background in statistics would do it.

The fact that you're making this error means that you don't really understand how to deal with data like this at all, and you should probably severely ramp down your confidence in your beliefs.

You can [manipulate](https://wildfiretoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Acres-burned-wildfire-US.jpg) the [trendline](https://wildfiretoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Acres-all-50-states-1986-2012.jpg) by arbitrarily picking different start and end dates.

&gt; One factor in the recent fires is almost certainly inadequate forest management, but it is far from the only factor.

I didn't say it was the only factor. I said it was a large factor.

It is a larger factor than global warming is.

But global warming is a factor as well.

Year to year fluctuations are caused by variations in climactic conditions.

&gt; Of the estimated eight million species on Earth, a million are now threatened with extinction, one expert warns.

These numbers are entirely made up.

There are 41,415 species on the IUCN redlist, of which 16,306 of them are endangered species threatened with extinction

https://www.endangeredearth.com/#:~:text=THE%20PLIGHT%20OF%20ENDANGERED%20SPECIES%3A,endangered%20animals%20and%20endangered%20plants.

People constantly fabricate numbers like these which have zero scientific basis.

&gt; Since 1970, vertebrate animals - birds, mammals, reptiles, fish and amphibians - have declined by 60%, another tells us.

This is also fabricated. I literally pointed this out elsewhere in the thread.

https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2018/11/animal-decline-living-planet-report-conservation-news/

It's an example of abuse of statistics.

That's not to say that the number of wild animals is not in decline - it is - but the number you're citing is flat-out false. It isn't what the number means.

As explained in the article:

&gt; Let’s say for example you have 50 tigers, 200 falcons, and 10,000 squirrels. Let’s say the first population declines by 90 percent, to 5 tigers. The second declines 80 percent, to 40 falcons. And the squirrels drop to 9,000—a 10 percent fall. That’s a 60 percent average decline of these three fictitious populations, but only a total decline of 12 percent of the individuals.

Again, you don't understand this stuff at all.

&gt; You seem stuck in an anti-malthusian mindset. A view that where, just because something has never happened before, then it can't possibly ever happen.

You are indistinguishable from the followers of Harold Camping.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Camping

Repeated failed prophecies, repeated scrambling to try and find another date for the apocaylpse and a new justification for it.

Repeated failure.

But you don't abandon it, because your belief in the apocalypse was never based on logic, it is based purely on faith.

This is why you're getting so upset at me - because I'm challenging your core belief in an upcoming apocalypse.

You need to accept that you've been indoctrinated into an apocalyptic cult, and get out of it.

The entire idea of a Malthusian catastrophe is completely false. It's not how reality works.

Here's how science works: you make a prediction, and you test it.

If your hypothesis repeatedly fails, it means you're wrong, and you need to abandon it.

This is precisely what has happened.

In real life, per capita agricultural productivity has been going up steadily because of improvements in technology.

Which is exactly what scientists predicted.

&gt; So we keep using fossil fuels? You might have missed the whole, IPCC project this path puts us on a 3C+ warming track. That is widely regarded as incompatible with organised human civilisation.

Nope. Only the cult members believe that global warming will end civilization.

There's no scientific basis for that belief whatsoever.

Indeed, the entire idea is *obviously* delusional.

Seriously. THINK.

Humans live in regions that differ by far more than 3 degrees centigrade in average annual temperature *right now*.

In fact, humans live in regions that differ by more than *20 degrees centigrade* in average annual temperature. People live in places like Anchorage, Alaska and Phoenix, Arizona.

The idea that three degrees centigrade of difference will cause global civilization to collapse is completely irrational.

It's not grounded in logic or reason, let alone science.

It's just delusion, pure and simple.

Seriously. Why would you believe this?

The answer is simple: indoctrination.",1600006211,g542h3j,t1_g51bitb,/r/Futurology/comments/ircmvp/jacinda_ardern_wants_to_accelerate_new_zealands/g542h3j/,0,Futurology,comment

My talking points are a direct reflection of firsthand experience. Years of experience seeing Sierra Club and others hold up proactive projects in the name of environmental protection.

I would never attest that the republicans are pro science. But the scientist, biologist etc I’ve worked with (really starting to feel like a broken record having to repeat that) are as Democrats and tree huggers as you get, and they too are firmly on the side of more proactive management because they have seen it work, again, firsthand.

I’m sorry but I’m really frustrated by your insistence on telling me, you live in chaparral land, saying it can be “raked” is I am in complete agreement a stupid statement. But chaparral can completely be managed and maintained similar to other fuel types. Again first hand experience with this on the Coronado NF.

The wall, military budget, racism and all that Jazz is a whole other discussion away from what we were focused on here I’d prefer not to get sidetracked. That said completely agree it’s a bullshit thing and we have plenty of money to put towards proactive management of our forests instead of useless border walls and feeding the MIC. But again that’s off track.

Also I think you have a very hateful look towards republicans. I wholeheartedly agree that many are absolutely bananaland stupid. But I’ve worked with plenty who are passionate environmentalists they just prefer to act rather than sit back and watch beetle kill continue to burn everything to nothing.

I’ve really enjoyed this discourse and civility but I think we have to just agree to disagree, although I truly don’t think we are that far off. I’ve presented several proactive ideas, I’m all ears on hearing some from you, besides endlessly defending the SC( which again I support, but not on this issue) and blaming and hating republicans (again, I’m here for that on 99% of topics but not this one).",1600007884,g546v0c,t1_g540w88,/r/Futurology/comments/iqt0j8/the_fires_raging_out_west_are_unprecedented/g546v0c/,1,Futurology,comment

Now, it only works as long as the temperatures are within the the temperature range the refrigeration gas can operate at, but if it is we can move heat rather than create it. 

Take that example of yours, when moving heat from inside to outside the AC would pump gas from the interior pipes to the exterior pipes. This lowers the pressure of the interior refrigeration gas pipes and cools the gas in the interior pipes which in turn cools the room. In the exterior pipes on the other hand, the pressure rises and, by the ideal gas law, so does the heat and the pipes that heating up the outside. This is why the back of the refrigerator or freezer gets hot.

I believe it’s usually 24-36 miles from shore though it’s been a while so I don’t recall specifics.

As you pointed out the U.S. spend significantly more per capita then we do in Canada.  for significantly less results.  I'm certainly not arguing that fact.

Also your ignorance of how the Corruption Perceptions Index is calculated is showing.  Perhaps a little more research and you would realize that Transparency International uses expert assessments to calculate their index every year.

 CPI takes into account 16 different surveys and assessments from 12 different institutions.   The 13 surveys/assessments are either business people opinion surveys or performance assessments from a group of analysts.

While it is true the CPI used public opinion survey's prior to 2012, they stopped doing that and only used trusted experts to calculate their index ranking since 2012.

And hey, Canada isn't perfect.  We are currently 12th on the index of most corrupt countries so we have room to improve (which we are doing as we went up 2 points since last year)... mind you the U.S. fell to 23, dropping 2 points last year so you seem to be moving in the wrong direction.",1599832265,g4tnir5,t1_g4tlz6s,/r/Futurology/comments/iq42mp/were_no_28_and_dropping_a_measure_of_social/g4tnir5/,1,Futurology,comment
931,icomeforthereaper,t2_2970s2nc,"Average incomes declined because the post war boom we had ended. After world war two europe was in ruins, and asia was barely developed. In the years right after the war the US alone accounted for fifty percent of global gdp. Fifty percent! Today we account for 15%. 

So that allowed us to build a massive middle class. The lower population helped too, because land was less desirable. That's why boomers could buy houses and put their kids through college on a factory workers pay. 

Trickle down is not and never was an actual economic theory espoused by any economist or even reagan himself. Seriously. Go try and find any economist using that term non pejoratively. You won't because no one did. 

&gt; The US stopped taxing the rich and corporations, so now the middle class or below gets to pay all the taxes.

That is not even close to being true. The top twenty percent of income earners in this country pay 87% of all federal income taxes. You want to take a guess what percentage the bottom fifty percent pay? 

&gt; Productivity, meanwhile, has gone up at least 6 times since then

Right. But increased productivity means fewer jobs almost by definition. Automation, offshoring manafacturing, and massive influxes of low skilled immigrants both legal and illegal was the final nail in the coffin.

Costs for technology have gone down by many orders of magnitude. Computers used to be $10,000. In fact, most consumer goods are much, much cheaper now thanks largely to offshoring manafacturing, and just in time supply chains. 

Now the middle class is growing in the developing world while its shrinking here. You could argue BECAUSE it's shrinking here. But is it fair that a family in bangladesh gets indoor plumbing and wifi while the us middle class shrinks? Kind of a tough to say a factory worker here who lives like a king compared to that family deserves those gains more.",1599832294,g4tnkp6,t1_g4sx8vr,/r/Futurology/comments/iq42mp/were_no_28_and_dropping_a_measure_of_social/g4tnkp6/,1,Futurology,comment

Agree that it needs to be compared to similiar sized car haulers.  I'm seeing people throwing around numbers for fuel costs that compare this to a neopanamax, when that ship carries way more cargo, and different cargo.

It's definitely an interesting concept.  The trade winds help it out, but also mean it would have to go a longer way around then just back and forth across the atlantic.

That's if the reactor even gets built - half the USA build attempts were cancelled after wasting billions.

1136,MrGraveyards,t2_2rhhh62u,"I think it's a problem of cost, so they want to have a cheaper option so not everybody has to pay 100k for a Tesla, so at first they were making cars that are simply less capable, but this leaves them with a more complicated factory or even an extra factory to make the cheaper cars. Apparently it's cheaper to make it all the same, but limit some cars so more people have access to it and sell more. So to take away the software locks they'd have to raise the price of the basic model to stay profitable or at least keep the same amount of profit.

From the consumers point of view it makes zero sense, but from a business point of view it makes a lot of sense, it's an economics of scale solution.

Also you can see it as 'be happy the car is available for a this low price point and shut up about that it can actually do more, because it that would be available you might not be able to afford the car'.

&gt;2) Slash transmission costs and efficiency losses because more power is generated where it's used. 

&gt;&gt;Power generation also has its efficiency, you know. There is a reason if utility scale solar plants can get you double (or maybe it was just 1.5x) the kwhs per fixed price than panels on roofs.

Still transmission costs are really high. Generation close to the point of consumption makes a lot of sense in many situations. 

&gt;More disaster tolerant communities and homes since not as many can be cut off from the grid in one fell swoop. 

&gt;&gt;I don't know how it works in countries with hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis and godzillas.. but I think no serious grid whatsoever has just a single point of failure (and I honestly can't remember last time any such scenario happened in europe)

So, no fires in Greece? Flooding in France? Storms never hit the UK and Italy never has an earthquake? There's never a war in the Balkans?

1187,NotAHost,t2_12969s,"Limiting hardware so that manufacturers can sell a single model at different price points is done in countless industries as normal practice, and most of the population is oblivious to it. The caveat, generally, is that enabling the disabled features often voids warranties and comes with additional risk. The warranty has a value. 

The company can offer free updates, and people can judge a company for selling software locked tiers of performance. They are mutually exclusive. The 'correct' solution would be to 'average' the prices of all the tesla software features and change the minimum price of a tesla vehicle to incorporate that. Do customers want the freedom of a cheaper Tesla by not paying for features they don't want? Or would they rather everyone be forced to pay for features they may not need so that those that want the feature can pay less? This also could help people enjoy features they wouldn't have paid for otherwise, who may then end up enjoying the car even more.

By the end of it, if you want the software features, pay for it, or if you don't like the prices, don't get the car. There are plenty of alternative vehicles.

1189,VorianAtreides,t2_6cnat,"&gt;they don't artificially limit performance to try to extract more money from customers.

This is patently false though - BMW artificially limits the performance of their engines. Case in point - the M2 competition and M2 CS versions. the DME handles the tuning for their engines, even though they're identical.

I think it goes without saying that non-EVs are just as 'digital' or software controlled/limited as their EV counterparts nowadays. It's a scummy tactic, but lets not pretend like Tesla is the only one who does this shit.

The fuel cell does help to an extent, but you can't really replace the internal combustion engine in cars with fuel cells and so you need batteries, which negates the efficiency boost. 

in the future fuel cells and hydrogen might do it, but i suspect fusion power will blow that out the water.

1257,applebutters7462947,t2_7p76md5n,"There have been instances of people who were blinded as children recovering sight as adults. They are still effectively blind in many ways because their brain cannot process visual information. They have difficulty recognizing familiar people and objects. Being able to visually scan and then explore your environment, for example, is necessary to form depth perception, which is just one component of vision. If you're unable to do that during formative years, then, yes, you will lose the ability to do so later on. If you put a child in a dark room alone during their formative years, you will effectively blind them even if nothing was originally wrong with their eyes or brain. If you dont use it during development, you lose it.

What ultimately happens is that the person has vision but the brain can't process it. We see this in children with cortical visual impairments (vision loss resulting from an issue with the brain, not an issue with the eyes itself). You really have a small portion of time to build the neurons that enable meaningful sight, which is why we do so many interventions just to get them to intentionally gaze at a target. This gets much more difficult as the individual gets older and their brain is less able to form the connections needed.

1272,Gagarin1961,t2_4h6q84a5,"&gt;**Within industries adopting automation**, the study shows, the average “displacement” (or job loss) from 1947-1987 was 17 percent of jobs, while the average “reinstatement” (new opportunities) was 19 percent. But from 1987-2016, displacement was 16 percent, while reinstatement was just 10 percent. In short, those factory positions or phone-answering jobs are not coming back.

First of all, why are they only looking at industries adopting automation? Why wouldn’t new jobs in industries not adoption automation matter at all? 

Second, it doesn’t seem clear how they accounted for changes due to international economic growth. I don’t like when studies claim automation is reducing the number of jobs... but that’s just isn’t true most of the world. The number of jobs (non agricultural) in the world has actually dramatically increased by literally *billions* since 1987. All of their factories have implemented levels of automation, it’s got they stay competitive with the rest of the world

This claim is only true if you look at the US.  But since the global economy has drastically changed so much over the last 40 years, I find it hard to believe it’s not the driving factor, far far more than automation. The US isn’t the only extremely productive country in the world anymore, Americans are competing against billions of people for work these days. And since they didn’t address this in the article about their study, I find it very frustrating that they are making such strong claims when they are completely ignoring other major factors.

1335,grumpieroldman,t2_ypz0b,"This is a very important question and it is vital that people know the answer.  
  
Solar-panels make sense when you are putting them on already-existing man-made structures, e.g. on top of buildings.  
  
But what you suggest, a coop buying land, is egregious environmental damage because thee most precious resources is habitat. Solar-panels also produce waste of an as-of-yet unknown toxicity. The environmental consequences of the nano-particles are not known.  
  
For wind-mills the environmental damage is know as they produce an astounding 36 tonnes of hazardous fiber-glass waste every 10 to 12 years because the blade-assemblies wear-out on-top-of their egregious land use. The notion of putting them in the water is an *even worse* idea as 11/12^th of the shallow ocean habitat has already been destroyed.  
  
A roll-out of solar and/or wind to furfill baseload and peak would be an environmental catastrophe destroying more of what little habitat remains. Solar and wind **ARE NOT SOLUTIONS**. They cause more damage.  
  
The best course of action is nuclear for baseload and natural-gas for peak. Natural-gas burns 4x clearner than oil or coal - that is a **massive** improvement. The thorium decay chain is preferred but failing that then uranium it is. This needs to hold us over until fusion-power is commercialized.  
  
I could go on at length but if the current media cycle has taught you nothing else at least regard how they sensationalize everything and their presentation of global-warming is no different.

No. You stated that only the French program was worth discussing.

&gt; Again, that's great, but the capacity is nowhere near what the grid requires. A decade or more of intensive investment is required before these technologies will be capable of supporting the grid.

They are barely starting, so yeah it's not immediate. Your ""decade or more"" is not sourced.

&gt; We're going to be burning an inordinate amount of natural gas through at least 2035 chasing an all renewable+storage energy solution. Your original assertion that renewables do not need natural gas backup is shown to be demonstrably false by these links you've provided.

This is not contradictory at all. My claim is that natural gas will not be needed once the low-carbon investments will have been made. I didn't say that the transition would be instantaneous.

&gt; Only if you completely ignore the carbon emissions of the reservoir the hydroelectricity generator requires, which at least some of those figures do. Include those emissions and it makes coal look clean.

1466,thecftbl,t2_ixand,"That's an absolute straw man of an argument. No one is advocating lower housing costs because it is fair and they have a right. What they are advocating for is that housing costs reflect market values and aren't dictated by forces with zero oversight or limitations. Keep in mind how bad it is for the economy to have a stifled housing market. For one, we have foreign investors who literally just buy up property and let it sit because it is a way to keep equity and wealth out of the hands of their respective governments (looking at you China.) When that happens the house becomes dead weight on the economy because there is no flow of capital apart from property taxes. It would be an entirely different argument if they were rental properties but they are not. That is just one problem, the other is when you have massive rental corporations buying up entire tracts of housing for the sake of a monopoly. In a free market if you were renting from someone and they exorbitantly hiked up your rental prices, you could give them the finger and find a better deal. But when that company owns every home in the area, there is no competition and they have created a monopolistic feedback loop allowing them to charge whatever they want because there is no alternative.

You keep saying that it lies solely with personal responsibility when it doesn't. Yes people can be smarter with their money, but that doesn't excuse the obvious manipulation of the market. Make no mistake, if this continues it will lead to another housing collapse and everyone will suffer because of it.",1599406479,g48mgc8,t1_g48l86t,/r/Futurology/comments/indf5d/52_of_young_adults_in_the_us_are_living_with/g48mgc8/,1,Futurology,comment

The researchers thus conclude that 'Power to Methane' is indeed a promising research direction for certain geographical sweet spots in the world where there are many CO2emissions (near large scale industry for example, called point sources), together with the production of [renewable electricity](https://phys.org/tags/renewable+electricity/). Examples of such CO2 point sources are petrochemical and metallurgical industries, both present in the Netherlands.

The main problem is to design a building from the ground up to support this weight is very costly, usually 75%+ more than a standard build.

What's amazing to me is that the same type of people screaming about doing whatever it takes to fight off climate change balk at the cost of nuclear despite nuclear being better than every solution even in the best case scenario.  

This is what makes me speculative about all of the investments we're making into wind and solar because even in a BEST CASE scenario, it's still not even going to hit closes to what nuclear does already.

To build a nuclear power plant, the costs are between 6 billion dollars and 9 billion dollars.  In the past 10 years, there has been a 2.6 TRILLION DOLLAR investment in other clean energy solutions.  The amount of nuclear power plants we could have built with that amount of money could have replaced the entire US power generation with nuclear.

On top of that, if we actually focused on building nuclear, we could also significantly reduce the cost as a result of it.  So even taking that one step further, we can bring that solution to being even cheaper.",1599317007,g44nb60,t1_g44fvxw,/r/Futurology/comments/imxux1/the_american_wind_energy_association_awea_plans/g44nb60/,1,Futurology,comment

I wasn't talking about Chem batteries. And if i was Chem batteries will continually improve. People are continuously researching different ways of storing energy. It will always be a good item to research and fund so it probably isn't going away either. 

The big difference here is the design of the grid. It doesn't have to be any more dangerous than it is now. People do it all the time.

If the grid fails, you have no power. That is the situation right now and that is pretty archaic. At this point in tech, it is cheap and easy to implement alternative energy to your own house.

Why do we use AC in our house? Because it is easier to move electricity long distances in this form. Not because it is best for the citizen. Big companies are not going to make decisions that are best for the citizen. They were raking it in with coal. That is why we are having such difficulty moving out of it.

4.  Storage of waste, why make something so hard to deal with in the first place?

5. The Limited supply. If we completely transition to this we have say 200 years of fuel assuming the population keeps growing.

So you will have to unpack your statement a little more clearly with references ideally.

You also haven't done your calculations on the potential of EV storage. Say you have an ev runabout car. You can tell your car that you need only 20 miles range on any one day  so that leaves 95% of that cars battery free for storage. If half of all cars are like this then it still supplies a massive amount of strorage - given most countries are switch to all ev's by 2035. Due to a potential pay back scheme and the low degradation of modern batteries EV owners are keen to implement this scheme.

Another simple way around it is to over supply wind and solar so that the country is usually at 100% renewables and if some strange drop of wind occurs you may have to switch a lot of gas power back on - but still over the year you are at 80% or above renewables. 

Another way I believe you are incorrect is the recent incredibly low price of electricity storage means that wind plus storage looks to be about the same price as levelised gas costs.

1609,Alex_2259,t2_li3zgat,"Also, buying used enterprise grade hardware (weather it be computers or servers) can be another good way to get long lasting components.

It's a shame some companies just scrap and trash their old servers and computers. I've seen companies be denied the ability to donate them to nearby schools (absurd) when really only the hard drives should be removed. Refresh cycles vary from 3-5 years, a computer/server can last 7-10. Especially in a school, where uptime isn't exactly as important as an enterprise.

In the era of sealed, E-Waste generating, all form no function laptops (MS surface, Macs), buying refurbished enterprise laptops is a smart idea. You can usually upgrade the components (designed to be serviced by IT departments) and replace the battery for a long lasting laptop. Enterprise hardware effectively works around the new no function all form trend while still giving you modern hardware. Even buy them new, they're more durable as well!

Some companies send the equipment to recycling companies en mass, so it can be semi cheap if they don't idiotically shred thousands worth of computers.",1599226951,g3zdngt,t3_imez6s,/r/Futurology/comments/imez6s/the_right_to_repair_could_help_address_a_critical/g3zdngt/,1,Futurology,comment

1664,SumDumScientist,t2_agthw,"Environmental scientist here. Primitivism and degrowth cannot physically solve climate change. It's bizarre that so many of my colleagues have such a huge blind spot on this issue and make this error so often. These are ideologically-driven, not evidence based.

Although the details are debated, it seems likely that as long as CO2 concentration is above natural equilibrium of around 280ppm, we will have continued climate change impacts including melting ice sheets and sea level rise. 

This ""inertia"" in the system means that even if all new GHG emissions dropped to zero tomorrow, we would still have catastrophic impacts from climate change due to the &gt;400ppm CO2 already in the atmosphere. Since it would take at least decades and maybe centuries for natural equilibrium ppm to be restored, climate change is still a huge problem for many decades *even if all humans disappeared tomorrow*.

Lifestyle changes that reduce emissions by reducing consumption don't pull even a single gram of CO2 out of the atmosphere. So they are not a real solution for climate change. Planting trees is of course a good idea, but it cannot sequester enough carbon to fully return us to 280ppm.

It is far too late to solve climate change with primitivism and austerity.

Our only chance to really prevent climate change impacts now is gigantic global CO2 withdrawal megaprojects. We need to take 500+ gigatons of carbon out of the atmosphere within two or three decades, or we will still face catastrophic impacts.

We can't do those megaprojects by destroying the global economy and returning to the trees. Our only chance now is to maintain a thriving economy and focus on technological engineering solutions. The opportunity to solve climate change with social changes alone expired 10-20 years ago.",1599228230,g3zh5w2,t1_g3xqdsk,/r/Futurology/comments/im23os/too_much_doom_and_gloom_aka_too_much_rule_2_break/g3zh5w2/,1,Futurology,comment

I like that these kids are trying to bring change. But they're unloading the creativity and ingenuity needed for that change onto someone else.  

Suing other countries is great. But what do you expect them to do?   With what solutions? Funded by who's money?  Impacting the citizens and children of those countries as well no doubt.  

The easiest thing in the world is to speak up, but it usually doesn't go any farther than that.

It's hard to conceptualize how an individual citizen can impact a company, since you don't get a cute badge that says ""I bought shares of amazon,"" but when a company does something dumb, their stock tanks, and they can't acquire equity. It's much more effective than say, voting in a district that is constantly red or blue. 

I have a feeling that people that don't trust public companies often just don't understand how they work, and worse yet, they pass on that ignorance to anyone that will listen, further weakening the voice of the individual american.

Nuscale abandoned their produce SMRs in a factory to save costs, and will rely on traditional supply chains.

https://losalamosreporter.com/2020/08/22/get-out-of-the-fluor-nuscale-small-modular-reactor-project/

&gt; the plan to save costs by fabricating the modules at a remote factory and shipping them to the Idaho site has been abandoned. The artful response to my question said that Nuscale engaged with approximately 40 … pressure vessel fabricators worldwide and … determined that Nuscale will use existing factories … in lieu of building its own factory.

&gt;The major module subcomponents will be manufactured at multiple manufacturer locations and shipped to a single location for assembly prior to installing into the facility.” This signifies the failure of one of the major cost-saving features of the Nuscale project, which was to forestall this exact scenario.

Very few cities have joined the project, and they are already dropping out

&gt;The Fluor/Nuscale scheme to finance the development of this reactor by enlisting many small municipal utilities to subscribe to the power is only about 30% subscribed, and two municipalities recently dropped out while one new one opted in.

If it does not get over a billion in subsidies, they will look at cancelling it entirely.

https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy/nuclear-advocates-fret-as-first-maker-of-small-reactors-encounters-trouble

&gt; UAMPS, as the coalition is known, could still abandon the project altogether. It is planning to convene in mid-September to approve a budget and could decide then to quit. The group says it is in negotiations with the Energy Department for the federal government to provide a $1.4 billion grant, which the utilities say they need to defray the rising cost of buying nuclear power.

It is already exploding in cost, in the normal tradition of nuclear projects.

https://www.heraldextra.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/lehi-city-council-votes-to-back-out-of-nuclear-power-project-contract/article_0af6e67c-24e5-5427-9029-e52b9f9d63ae.html

&gt; Earlier this month, the Utah Taxpayer Association called on cities to withdraw from the project ahead of the Sept. 14 deadline after a closed-door virtual town hall meeting on July 21 where officials warned of project delays, increased costs to cities and towns involved, and “dependence on unpredictable federal subsidies.”

&gt; “The UAMPS project will lock in 27 municipalities in Utah and several in surrounding states for a share of billions of dollars in costs and unclear risk in the pursuit of a cluster of small modular reactors (SMRs) touted by Oregon-based NuScale Power, which repeatedly has delayed timelines and increased costs associated with its SMRs,” Utah Taxpayer Association Vice President Rusty Cannon said in an Aug. 4 news release. “The risky project with massive cost escalations is being conducted largely out of the public eye.”

Anyway, as usual nuclear energy will be a black hole for subsidies and abandoned partway through, wasting the money.

The same investment in wind and solar would actually give decarbonization, faster.  But of course this sub will stan for a meme technology without a future like SMRs.",1599141327,g3ufyec,t3_ilpzmi,/r/Futurology/comments/ilpzmi/us_gives_firstever_ok_for_small_commercial/g3ufyec/,1,Futurology,comment

&gt;Humans comprise about 100 million tonnes of the Earth's dry biomass,[37] domesticated animals about 700 million tonnes, earthworms over 1,100 million tonnes,[28] and annual cereal crops about 2.3 billion tonnes.[38]

&gt;The most successful animal species, in terms of biomass, may well be Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, with a fresh biomass approaching 500 million tonnes,[34][39][40] although domestic cattle may also reach these immense figures.[citation needed] However, as a group, the small aquatic crustaceans called copepods may form the largest animal biomass on earth.[41] A 2009 paper in Science estimates, for the first time, the total world fish biomass as somewhere between 0.8 and 2.0 billion tonnes.[42][43] It has been estimated that about 1% of the global biomass is due to phytoplankton,[44] and 25% is due to fungi.[45][46]",1599141576,g3ugnm9,t1_g3ub0s2,/r/Futurology/comments/ilpvqf/as_much_as_half_of_the_worlds_water_supply_is/g3ugnm9/,1,Futurology,comment

Unless you are at a State Park, day passes for which sell out a month in advance - it isn’t going to happen.  Yes you technically could float any river but you can only put in and take out at a park or highway crossing, and most highway crossings lack parking.  Also most rivers here are very shallow a so a long kayak float gets difficult as well because of dry spots.


The one protection is access to beaches   for which you can cross private property, and that is also under attack from lobbyists that want it changed.

1837,Helkafen1,t2_xqgwz,"&gt; The figre I'm talking about is from here, and is not the one you talk about. Belgium, France and Sweden did the fastest decarbonization effort to date per capita - and France showing how to do it in large scale.

It's essentially the same data I was criticizing, but without the unfortunate 10-year averaging. It still suffers from the same fundamental problem: in the past, any decarbonization was *necessarily* driven by hydro, nuclear or geothermal because wind and solar *used to be very expensive*. It says very little about recent dynamics.

&gt; Going from your other comment, this is also very misleading. Decentralized intermittent renewables face other issues than cost. Just look at the recent development speed of renewables in Germany for the last few years - rapidly slowing down wind turbine buildout, despite the cost being way lower than it was 10 years ago.

It's the problem of a densely populated region, which played even more strongly against nuclear, and it's specifically about onshore wind. It's unfortunate and I hope it's only a temporary problem, and I wouldn't use Germany's NIMBYism as an argument for nuclear ;)",1599055631,g3pxgs0,t1_g3p4d17,/r/Futurology/comments/ii2ksb/bill_gates_nuclear_venture_plans_reactor_to/g3pxgs0/,1,Futurology,comment

A UFO hoax would have been much cooler and much more worth the effort",1599057444,g3q1nw2,t1_g3q1f1b,/r/Futurology/comments/ikx5c8/airline_pilots_landing_at_lax_report_a_guy_in/g3q1nw2/,1,Futurology,comment

1893,wdcpdq,t2_5x7f6iqv,"While I also do as much as I personally can (including eating less meat), the real solution is “stronger together”, but as in voting for politicians that believe in climate change and are willing to do something about it. Individual action isn’t sufficient in the face of overwhelming industrial inaction. In fact, no amount of reduction will save us at this point, we must both reduce and industrially remove CO2 that past generations have emitted. 

The economy is broken and will need to be fixed. The fix must including serious greening, or it’s no fix at all. I predict that many will declare the economy an emergency, and say that we can’t address climate change until it is better.  But there is no better time than when the world is in tatters to rebuild it greener and more equitably.",1599057513,g3q1tjq,t1_g3ph8bv,/r/Futurology/comments/il4yuf/gen_z_largely_believes_climate_change_is/g3q1tjq/,1,Futurology,comment

1896,Klyd3zdal3,t2_w5xem,"&gt; . . and are among the biggest donators to charity in the world.

The Catholic Church spreads poverty and misery wherever they have a foothold due to the stance on birth control, lbgtq rights, misogyny and the active support of pedophiles to name a few. That they donate pennies on the dollars to appear to rectify some of the wrongs they are largely responsible for (I’m referring to poverty and low education levels due to their demand that families churn out more and more victims for the church) deserves no praise.

&gt;Anyone who thinks we'd be better off without the church is actually pretty ignorant.

We would be much better off if people were actually connected with reality instead of deluding themselves with the woo woo pushed by the church.",1599057553,g3q1wvv,t1_g3lvtf0,/r/Futurology/comments/ikj62l/pope_use_pandemic_to_give_the_environment_a_vital/g3q1wvv/,1,Futurology,comment
