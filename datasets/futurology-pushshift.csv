The initial idea was fantastic, but it turned into a bit of a joke. An international organization receiving 70%+ of its funding from the U.S. doesn't make any sense. The U.N. should be able to generate its own income and be totally independent. Here's a plan below that obviously can be improved by the collective... (Please tear it apart and tell me why it's the dumbest idea you've ever seen on Reddit so I can stop thinking about it... :))

1 - The U.N. needs its headquarters to be 100% INDEPENDENT. Not New York. Not Geneva. It needs to buy land somewhere and make it its own territory, independent from one nation's laws.

2- The U.N. cannot be using the USD or EUR for operations. It needs its own currency, a cryptocurrency ideally.

3 - The U.N. should be structured like a legit ""country"", with its own basic industries in place. (It already has its own police, its own banks, its own hospitals, and even its own restaurants). It should have a blockchain-powered government and legal system where everyone has to participate as a condition to maintain their citizenship. The U.N. should also have an attractive immigration program in place to help grow its population and attract top talent.

4 - The U.N. needs its own Internet. This is a tall order, but hey perhaps Elon Musk can help with his Starlink satellites :)

5 - The U.N. needs to have one of the world's top 5 military forces. It's the only way they can truly guarantee world peace and be respected by *evil-doers*. I know it'll require humongous amounts of money, but I'm not saying this has to happen immediately. It should aim to get there over time.

6 - The U.N. needs a space program that can compete with the U.S., India or China. If aliens show up, they should be met by the U.N.. Not China, not with US or any other nation. :)",Futurology,United Nations 2.0 - Plan for a Future-Driven Organization,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/ixbn4y/united_nations_20_plan_for_a_futuredriven/,True,submission

I think each probe/ object we send for this purpose should have multiple options in terms of ways to get around the solar system. Like for example light sails/ magnetic sails so that if your near the massive magnetic fields of say Jupiter you could take advantage of that. If you are near the Sun then the light sail could be deployed.

Same for humans, yes they create other humans but they make wars and can bring dangerous technology, like the eventual ""black ball"". Any physical law, any even that make life possible, will inevitably destroy live.

Creating a new universe and jumping in it, is ofc impossible : once the universe is created, what do you do ? you jump in it randomly ? It detach from the parent universe anyway, so even that is forbidden.

Technology is something that is innovative, simplifies our life’s, gives us transportation, entertainment, connections around the world even the Internet especially now with the virus COVID-19 is the workplace from many people. Technology is murder, contamination, abuse of power, in many cases, creates humans deficient for simple tasks in the house or work. Also, technology is one of the major factors of the contamination and pollution around the world. But that’s not the technologies fault, it’s the immaturity of the people.

Nature gives us life, food, water, sun, air, animals, even shelter. It gives peace, oxygen that we need, and much more. When we compare technology with nature, is not a competition. Many people believe especially scientist and technologists that nature needs to be controlled by us, and it’s a little ironic, I mean we need to have control about solutions to live well, but we can’t control mother nature, it’s impossible, or at least while I’m still alive writing this.

Why humans now days are creating so much pollution and contamination around the world? It’s simple, because of two things, “the easy way”, “costs”, or even lack of care of nature. Technology is brilliant, we can use to save many things on earth, like animals, trees, and our drinking water. Technology now days is not fully advanced but its in the limit which we can use it to create unlimited projects. Wind energy, hydro energy and of course solar energy are the most echo friendly systems for generating clean energy for our homes, streets and enterprises.

There’s no completion between technology and nature, we need to save our planet efficiently. There’s much more to do without imitating our daily habits. Both in combination can create the biggest changes on out planet, our food, our water, our living and especially our energy. For me there’s not great excuse for building an echo friendly environment, just the government cutting economic support for innovation. United States and many other country’s yet try to buy the best deal of petrol, creating war, clearing contamination and destroying our earth. If we use our persistence for something positive, we can unite for a change, express idea, create projects, make movements and teach diplomatically people for not creating the mistakes we’re living on. We need to teach people, and especially our kids about the importance of nature, the reason why everything is created.

Remember, earth was alone, there was a time when people didn’t live on it, and when life was born on our planet, many changes occurred, and our planet is weak now. We destroyed our planet, and it’s our job to recover it.

We just released a new feature in our nootropics app. You can find out if a nootropic is effective for you with the help of scientific tests of cognitive performance and mood.

**To get a scientific answer to whether a nootropic is effective for you, do the following:**

1. Find a nootropic that you want to experiment with
2. Test yourself every day before and when using that nootropic
3. Get your results (which are calculated with automated statistical analyses)

It should take less than 10 minutes spread out over 10 days for you to find out if taking a nootropic for 5 days had an effect for you.

You can try it by signing up for an account here: [https://nootralize.com/self-experiment](https://nootralize.com/self-experiment)

We would love any feedback on whether this is useful for you, and whether you felt that it was easy to use.",Futurology,Find out if a nootropic is effective for you with the scientific self-experiments,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/it8h0i/find_out_if_a_nootropic_is_effective_for_you_with/,True,submission

## 🧬Featured Research

## [DNA Double Helix? Nah. Give Me Six!](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41557-020-0539-8)

DNA, the molecular blueprint of life, also moonlights as an origami artist. By carefully choosing a collection of DNA sequences, scientists can coax the strands to bend and fold into complex arrangements at a nanoscopic scale. [Lulu Qian](http://www.qianlab.caltech.edu/index.html), at Caltech, even used DNA origami to create “[the world’s smallest Mona Lisa](https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/worlds-smallest-mona-lisa-80563)” in 2017. But DNA nanostructures have thus far been limited in scale. A new paper from [Hao Yan’s](http://yanlab.asu.edu/People.html) group at Arizona State University has created a “six-helix bundle DNA origami nanostructure”, called meta-DNA, that can be used to construct larger, three-dimensional structures. The work was published in *Nature Chemistry*. [Read the ASU press release](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/09/200907112333.htm).

## [Apples Get Sick, Too. Can CRISPR Provide the Diagnosis?](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pbi.13474) (Open Access)

China produces nearly half of the world’s apples, which are subjected to an onslaught of viral pathogens. Those viruses have all sorts of fun names, like the “apple stem grooving virus” and the “apple scar skin viroid”. Fending off these viruses, and saving an orchard, demands early detection. That’s why Xianbo Zheng’s lab at Henan Agricultural University developed a CRISPR/Cas12-based system that can detect as few as 250 copies of certain viruses on an apple tree leaf, and return results in less than an hour.

*Here’s a riddle for you:* If an apple a day keeps the doctor away, what do apples eat to stave off illness?

## [Using Robots to Automate SARS-CoV-2 Testing](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18130-3) (Open Access)

When I studied at Imperial College, my dream was to use the Biofoundry. A full room, humming with robots, was surely the cure for my monotonous experiments. But, alas, it has been put to better use. In a *Nature Communications* article out this week, [Paul Freemont’s](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/p.freemont) group reports a “reagent-agnostic automated SARS-CoV-2 testing platform”. In other words, the Biofoundry was used to perform RNA extractions, RT-qPCR, and CRISPR-based detection methods for the virus. It was even tested on patient samples, installed in NHS diagnostic centers, and will purportedly increase “testing capacity by 1000 samples per day”.

## [Massive CRISPR Experiment Proves Not All Cas Proteins Are Equal](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0646-5)

When designing a gene editing (or base editing) experiment, it’s important to pick the right protein. Each Cas enzyme has its quirks—they differ in size and specificity, for example—but these differences are rarely *quantified*. Thankfully, [Ilya Finkelstein’s](https://finkelsteinlab.org/) lab at UT-Austin have published a paper, in *Nature Biotechnology*, that can help delineate the finer differences between Cas enzymes. In a massively parallel experiment, they benchmarked the cleavage and binding specificity for five SpCas9 variants and AsCas12a with “over 10,000 targets containing mismatches, insertions and deletions relative to the guide RNA”. The result? A better understanding of how mismatches between gRNA and DNA target alter the performance of a Cas protein (for example, “Engineered Cas9s, especially Cas9-HF1, dramatically increased cleavage specificity but not binding specificity compared to wtCas9.”)

## [Gene Expression Controlled with Light](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-020-0639-1)

Why use chemicals to control gene expression in a cell when you could use photons instead? Chemicals stick around for a long time; gene expression becomes “leaky”. Photons, on the other hand, can be easily tweaked, spatially controlled, and turned on and off (at the speed of light). To bring light-controlled gene expression to bacteria, the [Avalos lab](https://cbe.princeton.edu/people/jose-avalos) at Princeton has “developed a series of circuits for optogenetic regulation of the lac operon”, which they call OptoLAC, “to control gene expression from various \[chemical\] promoters using only blue light.” The study was published in *Nature Chemical Biology*.

A biosensor in plants was used to [quantify the uptake of sugar](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.03.282301v1) through SWEET transporters (what an amazing name) (*bioRxiv*). ***Open Access.***

A [feedback loop, built from pyruvate-responsive genetic circuits](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-020-0637-3), was used to control the central metabolism of *Bacillus subtilis.* The circuit detects pyruvate and adjusts its actions accordingly. When implemented in cells, it more than doubled the production of glucaric acid (*Nature Chemical Biology*).

A [CRISPR toolkit developed for yeast](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-71648-w), featuring dCas9 and a variety of activation and repression domains, can be used to quickly design and perform CRISPR experiments (*Scientific Reports*). ***Open Access***

Climate change is caused by many factors, but one that I will focus on now is global population. At almost 8 billion there are quite simply too many people on this earth. Each one emits a certain amount of carbon dioxide simply by living a normal life e.g. driving a car spews carbon dioxide from exhaust and eating meat wastes a significant amount of energy to keep cows and pig alive only to kill them.

As such, policies that reduce population growth (antinatalist policies) are better for the environment. When people think of antinatalist policies, one that comes to mind is China's One Child Policy, which was draconian. It featured forced sterilization, forced abortion, and government birth permits. However, there are ways of reducing fertility rate without resorting to draconian measures that cause suffering. In fact, most of the world has seen its fertility rate fall. Back in the 1960s, global fertility rate was about 5 babies per woman. Today is approximately 2.5 babies per woman. Once it gets to 2.1 babies per woman (i.e. replacement rate) then this means global population will cease to grow, which is a huge win for the environment.

But why did the world ex-China experience a fall in fertility rate without resorting to draconian measures? Many say it is urbanisation, female education, and availability of contraception. Urbanisation as opposed to rural living transforms babies from a productive asset that can work on the family work into a liability and recreational expense. Female education gives women other options rather than staying home and looking after children. It allows women to be productive rather than reproductive. Availability of contraception allows people to enjoy sex without the side-effects of contraception.

However, there are two other factors that I believe helped to reduce fertility rate: housing unaffordability and welfare for the old. The term ""greedy boomers"" comes to mind because these policies help older people. High house prices help the old who purchased homes in the past and were able to gain wealth through the rise in house prices, and older people vote for welfare due to self-interest e.g. age pensions as well as many subsidies for medicines, etc.

Housing unaffordaibility, in my opinion, reduces fertility because it reduces the wealth of young people. It is important to make the distinction between wealth and income. Less wealth reduces fertility rate, but less income increases fertility rate. You need wealth (assets minus liabilities) in order to afford to raise children. However, the lower your income, the less money you lose if you stay home to take care of a child. Young people are more fertile and more likely to have children vs old people. However, housing unaffordability means many young people pay more money to buy a home or rent a home. If a young person rents a home, high house prices means they pay more than rent assuming reasonably stable rental yield (i.e. rents rise as house prices rise). If a young person buys a home, if it is more expensive, they lose more money by living in the property because they miss out on renting it out and earning rental income. Whether you buy or rent, high house prices cause your wealth to be lower than what it would be if housing was affordability. This results in people deferring having children. Deferral of having children reduces the total number of children a woman can have, which reduces carbon emissions. 

Welfare for the old works to reduce fertility rate in two ways. Firstly, in order for the old to receive welfare, more taxes need to be applied on the young in order to fund pensions, subsidised hospitals and age care homes, etc. More taxes on the young reduces their wealth, which reduces fertility rate, which helps the environment. Another way welfare for the old helps to reduce fertility rate is that it gives people the confidence that they will be looked after by their government when they are older, which means they do not need to have children and expect these children look after them. In fact, if these children will grow up in a world where they need to work hard in order to afford a place to live and in order to pay taxes that will be redistributed to the old, they won't have time to look after their parents because they are too busy working. 

Both these two factors exhibit ""virtuous cycle"" properties e.g. for housing unaffordaibility, young people are forced to delay childbirth and work very hard in order to afford to get enough wealth to feel like they can afford children. Usually couples start to feel confident in having children once they save enough deposit or downpayment to get a mortgage from the bank to buy a home, but once they do, they now have an incentive to want that house to go up in value, which means they will vote for policies that cause more housing unaffordability, which puts more pressure on those even younger. For example, having been scrimping and saving under heavy taxes to fund boomers, millenials are now starting to buy homes in their thirties. They will want these house prices to go up and they will vote for policies such as tax benefits for housing. However, because this results in soaring house prices, this means that Gen Z will need to save up even more to get a mortgage, so they may need to work hard until they are in their 40s, and once Gen Z purchase as house, they too will vote for policies that cause housing unaffordaibility, which causes Gen A to wait until they are in their 50s to buy a house, and so on in a virtuous cycle that reduces fertility rate, carbon emissions, and saves the environment.

The same ""virtuous cycle"" is found in welfare for the old. Old people claim they are old, frail and need to be looked after, and they vote for policies that redistribute wealth from the young to the old. This puts pressure on the young who need to work harder in the face of high cost of housing and high taxes in order to get the wealth needed to have children. As a result, the young defer having children, but once the young get old, they have an incentive to keep the welfare going, so they will vote for policies that help the old, which puts more pressure on the young. Furthermore, as fertility rate drops, there are fewer and fewer young people who can vote, which means in a democracy, older people will continue to grow in political power and grab more money from the public purse, meaning the young are taxed even more, which means lower wealth, lower fertility rate, and lower carbon emissions.

In conclusion, ""greedy boomers"" help the environment by contributing greatly to global human population decline. Once millenials become the next boomers, we can expect the same behaviour and the same outcome, which is falling fertility rate, falling carbon emissions, and a better environment.",Futurology,Are greedy boomers good for the environment?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/ir1izx/are_greedy_boomers_good_for_the_environment/,True,submission

There are four known fundamental forces which control matter and therefore control energy, namely strong nuclear force, weak nuclear force, electromagnetic force, and gravitational force. In this hierarchy of forces, the electromagnetic force is perfectly positioned to be able to manipulate the other three. 

*electric universe theory confirmed?*

A stationary electric charge gives rise to an electric (electrostatic) field, while a moving charge generates both an electric and a magnetic field (hence the electromagnetic field). Additionally, an accelerating charge induces electromagnetic radiation in the form of transverse waves, namely light.

*Nikola Tesla supposedly discovered transverse waves shortly before his death, seems he might have been onto something?*

Mathematically, as well as physically, electromagnetic field intensity can be represented as the product of electric field strength and magnetic field strength. Electromagnetic fields act as carriers for both energy and momentum, thus interacting with physical entities at the most fundamental level (in this manner addressing the feasibility of countering the Earth-bound Asteroid Threat).

*this technology can deflect incoming asteroid threats!*

Artificially generated high energy electromagnetic fields interact strongly with the Vacuum Energy Field (an aggregate state composed of the superposition of all quantum fields' fluctuations permeating the fabric of Spacetime), thereby giving rise to Emergent Physical Phenomena (in other words revolutionary physics), such as Force and Matter Fields Unification. 

*confirmation of the “ether” or as they describe “vacuum energy field”*

According to Quantum Field Theory, this strong interaction between the fields is based on the mechanism of transfer of vibrational energy between the fields, further inducing local fluctuations in adjacent quantum fields which permeate Spacetime (these fields may or may not be electromagnetic in nature).

Everything that surrounds us, ourselves included, can be described as macroscopic collections of fluctuations, vibrations, and/or oscillations in quantum mechanical fields. Therefore, under certain conditions (such as the coupling of hyper-frequency axial spin with hyper-frequency vibrations of electrically charged systems) the rules and special effects of quantum field behavior also apply to macroscopic physical entities. 

*Surprise! Nikola Tesla was right again with his quote 
“If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration.” Looks like he hit it right on the head*

Along this line of thought, lightning can be explained as a Macroscopic Quantum Phenomenon which arises due to millions of ice particle collisions within storm clouds (thus giving rise to a sizeable electric charge), which generate electromagnetic fields locally interacting with the Vacuum Energy Field. Thus, the physics of lightning can be explained by extremely strong interactions between classical electromagnetic fields (storm clouds exhibiting 100 MV voltages and rapid air currents) and the quantum fields' superposition-induced Vacuum Energy Field.

*Basic earthly thing that happens all the time is proof of quantum mechanics/phenomena and interactions between electromagnetism and the Vacuum energy field*


Moreover, simultaneous coupling of hyper-frequency gyrational (axial rotation) and hyper-frequency vibrational electrodynamics (as used in the inventive concept herein disclosed) is conducive to a possible physical breakthrough (Force and Matter Fields Unification is feasible with the concept at hand) in the utilization of the Quantum Vacuum Plasma (part of the Vacuum Energy Field) as an energy source (or sink), an induced physical phenomenon, for which the technology readiness level has been considerably advanced by a team of research engineers from NASA JSC. Their research involves the use of high Radio frequency/Microwave driven resonant cavity Q-thruster technology within the context of Quantum Vacuum Plasma physics.

*so yeah we tested it, it works, let’s build like 12 and give them to our black ops, don’t use it for good of humanity or nothing. Also NASA has had this shit for a while, no biggie though. Meanwhile “NASA” are still getting off the planet with explosion propulsion LOL*

#[High frequency gravitational wave generator](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10322827B2/en?inventor=Salvatore+Pais)

On Feb. 11, 2016 the National Science Foundation publicly announced that the Laser Interferometry Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) finally detected gravitational waves, thereby, showing that gravitational waves exist, further strengthening General Relativity (GR) theory predictions.

Gravitational waves can be seen as undulations in the structure of spacetime, or to be more exact, ripples in the curvature of the spacetime fabric. These waves are propagating fluctuations in gravitational fields, which arise due to the dynamics of massive physical entities. The source of gravitational waves may not be massive in nature, as long as its motion is represented by high frequency/high energy far from equilibrium dynamics. This can be observed from the energy-momentum tensor expression in the GR field equations.

*So gravitational waves aren’t always produced by massive things, we have math to prove it!*

Because of their physical nature (the graviton being a spin 2 particle), gravitational waves have the capability to penetrate solid matter at high frequency (HFGWs), moving at the speed of light. Furthermore, similar to electromagnetic waves, these gravitational waves (GWs) are carriers of energy and momentum. Moreover, GWs are transverse and quadrupolar in nature (stretching and squeezing space along their propagation path), and can be produced by accelerating asymmetric masses. The emission of high frequency gravitational waves denotes far-form-equilibrium phenomena.

*Tesla again, was right about transverse waves aka Tesla waves. Gravitational waves are similar to electromagnetic waves, also re assuring that all the forces and the local vacuum energy can be manipulated by electromagnetism*

Electromagnetic (EM) radiation (caused by accelerating electrically charged objects) when passed through a static magnetic field (of constant magnetic flux density) gives rise to gravitational waves at the same frequency as the EM radiation. This phenomenon is known as the Gertsenshtein Effect and can be utilized for a variety of applications ranging from advanced field propulsion (space drive), to communication through solid objects, as well as asteroid (planetoid) disruption and disintegration (when coupled with high energy electromagnetic field fluctuations).

*Holy shit this tech is sweet and can do so much for humanity! Let’s also make 12 of these, give them to our black ops, and make sure they never are seen by the general populations*

The generation of high power high frequency gravitational waves (HFGWs) is just one application of the fundamental innovative principle behind this work, namely the enablement of macroscopic quantum coherence induced by controlled motion of charged matter, subjected to rapid acceleration transients. This principle can give rise to Emergent Physical Phenomena, such as, but not limited, to Superconductivity.

*Pretty simple, if you charge something electrically and then spin the fuck out of it, you fuck shit up basically. Superconductivity? Oh yeah that’s just a happy accident* 

Artificially generated high energy electromagnetic (EM) fields can interact strongly with the local Vacuum energy state (an aggregate/collective state comprised of the superposition of all fluctuations in the collective quantum fields permeating a given spacetime locality). According to quantum field theory, this strong interaction between the fields is based on the mechanism of transfer of vibrational energy between the fields, further inducing local fluctuations in adjacent quantum fields which permeate that spacetime locality (these fields may or may not be electromagnetic in nature).

*May or may not be electric universe theory confirmed? Tesla was right again, energy, frequency, and vibration are key. Damn that guy was smart! I wonder what they stole from his safe when he died?*

Local Vacuum energy state can be seen as the collective energy state (structure) which contains the ground state of minimum energy (baseline fluctuations) that is the quantum vacuum, and the excited state of energy (induced fluctuations) generated by matter or any other source of energy in that spacetime locality. According to quantum field theory, matter, energy, and spacetime are emergent constructs which arise out of a foundational structure, which is the Vacuum energy state. Matter is confined energy, bound within fields, and may be thought of as a spectrum of different vibrational (and possibly gyrational) frequencies of the Vacuum energy state. The engineering of the Vacuum metastructure (since there are multiple Vacuum structures) has been discussed from a General Relativity perspective, and from a quantum field theory perspective. We are immersed in an ocean of energy (the Vacuum energy state), yet ordinarily we seem not to interact with it. This is because under normal circumstances (at or near equilibrium), the Vacuum state is homogeneous, isotropic, Lorentz invariant, in other words, it is symmetric. If this symmetry (far-from-equilibrium) is broken and strong interactions with the Vacuum energy state become possible, the manner in which the collective fields exchange energy with one another will be affected.

*Highly energetic electromagnetic fields and really fast axial spinning directly interact with the sea of energy that surrounds us all the time, everywhere. It’s honestly not a hard concept to grasp, think about still water as the “vacuum energy” and your hand as “electromagnetism” take your hand and slosh the water about in random directions. What do you get? Energy.*

Furthermore, as observed from the Casimir effect, the boundary conditions of a physical system affect the local Vacuum energy state (VES) of that system (inclusive of zero point EM energy (QED) among other types of field energies (QCD, Higgs, etc.)), thereby, affecting the system's physical properties. Thus, by manipulating/modifying the boundary conditions of a physical system with respect to its local VES, we can alter the system's physical properties.

*Confirming that we can use this technology in some sort of craft and that we can also alter the physical properties of said craft. Mass reduction? Faster than light travel?*

Craft mass reduction effects are achieved by control (coherence) of the collective quantum fluctuations in the Vacuum energy state in the immediate vicinity of the aerospace vehicle/spacecraft's electrified outer mold skin. As a result, extreme craft speeds can be achieved. This concept relates to an EM device which induces vibratory mass/energy fluctuations within a structure, which may or may not be solid in nature (thus generated plasma non-linearities can be considered).

*Oh shit there’s the craft! Again sort of a simple concept, the charged “skin” of the craft interact with the vacuum energy field and produces extremely fast propulsion capabilities*

#[If you didn’t believe anything you just read, look at this.](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10144532B2/en?q=Craft+inertial+mass+reduction+device&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;oq=Craft+using+inertial+mass+reduction+device)

TL;DR: We literally have these 2 pieces of technology that can have incomprehensible effects on humanity’s greater good. They are obviously tied up in black ops projects and TPTB will never let them see the light of day. These alone would ruin - Big oil, Petro dollar, stock market, NASA, internal combustion engines, diesel, basically all fossil fuels, fracking, oil drilling, not to mention any sort of Hertzian communication waves, Big hydro, the list goes on. 

Anyways I hope some people do understand that the tech is there but only in secret.

But I am primarily afraid of another thing, 'cause for that thing you don't need an intelligence better or even equal to human, that thing is:
 
- Devaluing of our ""symbol"" system
 
By a ""symbol"" I mean pretty much anything, any **thought** or **emotion** or **memory**
 
For example face or voice or touch of your loving one are ""symbols"" - something that gets **imprinted** in your thoughts and **evolves** along with other thoughts

**Cultural appropriation**

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_appropriation

There's a concept of ""Cultural appropriation""

You are harming a symbol that is valuable for a culture by using it in a bad way and without any meaning

And of course to make harm you don't need to be smarter or as smart as the culture you are stealing from

So a relatively weak AI can do a lot of harm by stealing from humanity and you &amp; me personally

(Deep)Faking can do the same but much worse, appropriating just **everything** and ""culture"" of the whole humanity and of every single human in particular

**The Little Prince**
 
If you actually remember the book good enough, you can see that one of book's topics was about how ""symbols"" attain value and meaning
 
For example, at the end of the novel stars become much more meaningful for the Narrator, 'cause the Narrator now knows that any of them can be inhabited by the Flower and the Sheep and the Prince
 
&gt; *All men have stars, but they are not the same things for different people. For some, who are travelers, the stars are guides. For others they are no more than little lights in the sky. For others, who are scholars, they are problems... But all these stars are silent. You — You alone will have stars as no one else has them... In one of the stars I shall be living. In one of them I shall be laughing. And so, it will be as if* **all the stars will be laughing** *when you look at the sky at night. You, only you, will have stars that can laugh!*
 
I fear that a flood of fakes can do the reverse: everything will become ""silent"" for you and me, cause we will know that behind any ""voice"" can be a meaningless fake
 
It is the ""devaluing"" I'm talking about, I don't want this to happen
 
**But eyes are blind. You have to look with the heart.**
 
For me communication is based on trust and faith
 
I don't ask people to express mega-super-duper complex concepts stated explicitly
 
I don't ask all the meaning to be in the words and phrases themselves
 
For me it's enough to **believe** that person had a reason or a story behind those words, to get an impulse of **importance** of other person's words... **remember** them and maybe make additional sense of them much later
 
I don't want this level of communication to be ruined by fakes
 
I don't want all snakes that have eaten elephants to become just hats because elephant is not explicitly drawn
 
**Worse than hell**
 
The ""net"" of symbols that are valuable to you can be compared to the concept of a soul
 
So devaluing of symbols in that net can be compared to slow devouring of a soul
 
In its own way it is a fate literally worse than hell
 
You also will know that other souls are dying too and even kind of feel them dying by feeling how their representations in your mind disintegrate
 
If that's not bad I don't know what is
 
**A Net of Colours**
 
I believe in existence of a special thing, ""colors"" (I'm trying to prove the existence of that thing, but that's another story)
 
""Colors"" are something that is imprinted on everything related to humans (faces, voices, phrases, works of art, favourite things)
 
A ""color"" is not unique to a unique personality, but is strongly related to personality
 
""Colours"" are one of the reasons why I think that faking voices/faces/texts is such a bad idea
 
They are one of the reasons why I care even about ""strangers"" on the Internet being faked
 
**Colours make the harm just so much more objective and catastrophic for psyche**
 
Maybe knowledge about colours itself is dangerous in that sense too, but that knowledge at least gives you something of **value**

**conclusions**

You can write any reply you want, but I am most interested in question do you care about what I described **in general**, not in ""Is it logical to worry about it?

Blimps got out of use since the helium to fill them is quite rare at earth and it's impossible to create new (the only way to produce new is by nuclear fusion at the Sun), having instead to extract it from underground gas deposits. This made it necessary to use hydrogen to fill the blimp, and there you had the Hindenburg tragedy.

Now, fusion reactors. A fusion reactor is, basically, a controlled sun that takes hydrogen to produce energy and helium. This helium comes out ready to be captured, stored and used, therefore becoming a much more accessible substance. I think that in the future, blimps will be back, or at least some sort of blimp/big size drones, that will use the sustentation provided by the blimp to greatly reduce the energy needed for takeoff.

In fact, why stop there? With free and abundant helium, you could lift any weight. Helium blimp based cranes for construction, and even floating buildings or even cities, hovering with the sustentation of the helium produced by their own fusion reactors.

Is anyone familiar with the idea of using computers/databasing/relating data on the sum of human knowledge? Since that probably wasn't clear, let me explain. I think we're at a point in technological progress that we could upload the sum of human knowledge (an encyclopedia, a factbook of all scientific disciplines, history books, so on and so forth) into a computer database and have the computer make connections based on what we, as humans, have fed it.

I am a first time founder and I have been working on a Remote Working application from last 2 months. 

As a founder it is always challenging and I am looking forward for some help with feedback on my “AI-powered note taking applications”

I started to work on this from my personal pain points, I was having too much online meetings and at the end of the meeting I was wasting much of the time writing the notes and summary of the call. And also, during the meeting I was more focused on taking notes rather than listening to the conversation. 

So this lead me to work on my startup [https://rechord-ai.netlify.app](https://rechord-ai.netlify.app/)

**Here is what we did -** 

Made an AI bot “Eve”, the name can be customised as per requirements. Eve joins various online meeting platforms and records the meeting. 

**At the end of the meeting we have developed our own AI and NLP algorithm that gives you the following points -** 

* Full transcript of the meeting
* Speaker information
* Highlights of meeting
* Question asked 
* Metrics or any numbers that were discussed 
* Abstractive summary of the meeting 
* Action Items + Decision Points
* Minutes of the meeting

Also, we have made sure that you can the meeting notes with your participants with a public url and also you can download it in an excel format. 

From, last 2-3 weeks we have been talking to users and on-boarding to our Beta platform. 

I am looking for some more beta users who are willing to test the product and give us feedback.

Let me show you how the tool works and also, we will setup the tool for you, here is the link for scheduling a call with us - [https://rechord-ai.netlify.app](https://rechord-ai.netlify.app/)

Looking forward to talking to you and your feedback will be very useful for me and my team.",Futurology,"World is going remote, so making an application for remote work and note taking",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/io801h/world_is_going_remote_so_making_an_application/,True,submission

Imagine a system in which a private company as a ""government service provider"" offers you protection of life, liberty and property. This service includes internal and external security, a legal and regulatory framework, and independent dispute resolution. You pay a fixed contract fee for these services per year. The government service provider, as the community operator, cannot unilaterally change this ""citizen contract"" with you later. As a ""citizen by contract,"" you have a legal claim for compliance and a claim for damages in the event of non-compliance. You take care of everything else alone, but you can also do what you want, limited only by the rights of others and the moderate rules of living together. And you only participate if the offer appeals to you and as long as it appeals to you. Disputes between you and the government service provider are heard in independent arbitration tribunals, as is customary in international business law. If the operator ignores the arbitration awards or abuses his power in another way, his clients leave and he declares bankruptcy.

Now they're somewhat mainstream under the moniker eVTOL or PAV. However Aerospace/engineering subs still think they're stupid and drone subs are only interested in flying off-the-shelf stuff/taking pictures

I've been a huge fan ever since I saw the Omni Hoverboard fly. Since then there's been the Dubai Hoverbike and the Ehang 184. Battery and brushless motor tech has really come a long way, it's an exciting time. The criticisms are valid but I feel like no sub I've ever been to has ever been open minded about the possibilities and given it a chance to develop. It's always a load of jokes about 1 minute flight time and ""flying blender"" 

I myself have been working on small scale ducted fan eVTOL for a while. Ducted fans are smaller and safer than propellers and also look the part of an actual ""jetboard"". However ones large enough for eVTOL don't exist beyond one or two custom one-off designs I've seen that cost thousands. [My design](https://youtu.be/J559kJVT0xQ) is just a prototype I 3D printed for bench testing, if it's a success I'll make it out of something stronger

My next step is to experiment with something I don't see any eVTOL designers using which is Coanda effect lift. The US Army Hiller Flying platform got [40% extra lift from air flowing over the intake lip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cew5JF8q6eY) This could translate to big savings in battery power. The problem with it is that it makes forward flight difficult but it could be compensated for with modern electronics.

Here's what we got in the [latest](https://www.skynettoday.com/digests/the-eightieth) one:

### Mini Briefs

#### [The term “ethical AI” is finally starting to mean something](https://venturebeat.com/2020/08/23/the-term-ethical-ai-is-finally-starting-to-mean-something/)

As warnings about the dangers of AI have come to the fore, industry  and academia have answered with research, conferences, and institutes  all aimed at fair, ethical AI. The most recent wave, opposed to the  first that was dominated by philosophers, has been focused on technical  approaches to the problem. But technical fixes alone cannot wring all  the water from the sponge. In order to ensure that profit-seeking  institutions and other groups producing AI technologies are careful in  their quest to advance applications of the technology, a strong hand  will be needed to both oversee the research itself and to decide whether  or not that research should be used. Finally, a new wave in ethical AI  has taken us to “practical mechanisms for rectifying power imbalances  and achieving individual and societal justice.” The shift towards  socio-technical issues has laid the ground for the UK’s Court of Appeal  to find police use of facial recognition unlawful and call for a new  legal framework, for high school students to protest after their marks  were downgraded by an algorithmic system, and for countries like New  Zealand to publish charters and form task forces to provide guidance for  the use of algorithmic systems. Practical tools for accountability, and  the full participation of research institutes, activists, and  campaigners to make sure governments help in addressing these risks,  will be vital. Fortunately, movement towards more ethical use of AI  seems to have been mobilized by social pressure. That pressure will need  to be sustained, and perspectives beyond European and North American  actors will need to be surfaces, in order to make AI and data truly work  for everyone.

#### [Hulu deepfaked its new ad. It won’t be the last.](https://www.protocol.com/hulu-deepfake-commercial-ai)

Rather than going through the complicated logistics of flying out  actors during a pandemic, Hulu decided to simply fake its latest ad.  Using deepfake algorithms trained on footage of athletes such as Damian  Lillard and Skylar Diggins-Smith, the Hulu clip superimposed the faces  of the stars onto body doubles. This is not a new trend: State Farm ran a  commercial in April that featured deepfakes, while AI video startup  Synthesia, “which offers customers the ability to produce videos without  actors and film crews, has seen a 10x growth in demand since the  beginning of the pandemic.” Synthesia COO Steffen Tjerrild predicts that  “AI will eventually do to video production what apps like Instagram  filters did to photography.” Indeed, the technology appears to be  advancing quickly and the monetary incentives will be difficult for  companies to ignore. Just as much of our entertainment has been pervaded  by CGI, soon it may be populated by deepfakes.

#### Advances &amp; Business

* [Facebook is training robot assistants to hear as well as see](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/08/21/1007523/facebook-ai-robot-assistants-hear-and-see/)  \- In June 2019, Facebook’s AI lab, FAIR, released AI Habitat, a new  simulation platform for training AI agents. It allowed agents to explore  various realistic virtual environments, like a furnished apartment or  cubicle-filled office.  
 
* [The robot revolution has arrived](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2020/09/the-robot-revolution-has-arrived-feature/)  \- If you’re like most people, you’ve probably never met a robot. But  you will. I met one on a windy, bright day last January, on the  short-grass prairie near Colorado’s border with Kansas, in the company  of a rail-thin 31-year-old from San Francisco named Noah Ready-Campbell.  
 
* [Please remain calm while the robot swabs your nose](https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/24/21377011/robot-nasal-swab-machine-autonomous-covid-19-test-brain-navi)  \- If you’ve been tested for COVID-19 then you’ve probably experienced  the unpleasantness of a nasal swab. Someone takes a long-handled cotton  swab and sticks it up your nose–way up your nose–until it reaches the  back of the mucus-cave that is your nasal cavity.  
 
* [How AI and Art Hold Each Other Accountable](https://hai.stanford.edu/blog/how-ai-and-art-hold-each-other-accountable) \- The arts have a major role to play in the fairness of our technological future.  
 
* [The utopian promise and dystopian potential of real-time detection of police, fire, and medical emergencies](https://venturebeat.com/2020/08/27/the-utopian-promise-and-dystopian-potential-of-real-time-detection-of-police-fire-and-medical-emergencies/)  \- In 2014, John Garofolo went to Baltimore to visit Lt. Samuel Hood of  the Baltimore Police Department. Garofolo was previously head of  Aladdin, a program in the Office of the Director of National  Intelligence to automate analysis of a massive number of video clips.  
 
* [How Close Are Computers to Automating Mathematical Reasoning?](https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-close-are-computers-to-automating-mathematical-reasoning-20200827/) \- AI tools are shaping next-generation theorem provers, and with them the relationship between math and machine.  
 
* [AI Algorithm Reaches Equivalent Accuracy of Average Radiologist](https://www.diagnosticimaging.com/view/ai-algorithm-reaches-equivalent-accuracy-of-average-radiologist)  \- At least one algorithm is ready to pinpoint which women have breast  cancer without additional oversight or interpretation needed from the  radiologist. That’s according to one research team that compared the  performance of several AI tools.  
 
* [Impact of Go AI on the professional Go world](https://medium.com/@hajinlee/impact-of-go-ai-on-the-professional-go-world-f14cf201c7c2)  \- Professional Go players are often referred to as one of two types,  tournament players or teaching players. Tournament players are the ones  who spend most of their time and energy training and competing in  tournaments, and most of their income is tournament prize money.  
 

#### Concerns &amp; Hype

* [GPT-3, Bloviator: OpenAI’s language generator has no idea what it’s talking about](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/08/22/1007539/gpt3-openai-language-generator-artificial-intelligence-ai-opinion/)  \- Our tests show that the popular AI still has a poor grasp of reality.  Since OpenAI first described its new AI language-generating system  called GPT-3 in May, hundreds of media outlets (including MIT Technology  Review) have written about the system and its capabilities.  
 
* [GPT-3 Is an Amazing Research Tool. But OpenAI Isn’t Sharing the Code.](https://onezero.medium.com/gpt-3-is-an-amazing-research-tool-openai-isnt-sharing-the-code-d048ba39bbfd) \- For years, A.I. research lab OpenAI has been chasing the dream of an algorithm that can write like a human.  
 
* [The Impact of AI on Journalism](https://www.forbes.com/sites/calumchace/2020/08/24/the-impact-of-ai-on-journalism/)  \- Back in 2014, the Los Angeles Times published a report about an  earthquake three minutes after it happened. This feat was possible  because a staffer had developed a bot (a software robot) called Quakebot  to write automated articles based on data generated by the US  Geological Survey.  
 
* [Participation-washing could be the next dangerous fad in machine learning](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/08/25/1007589/participation-washing-ai-trends-opinion-machine-learning/)  \- Many people already participate in the field’s work without  recognition or pay. The AI community is finally waking up to the fact  that machine learning can cause disproportionate harm to already  oppressed and disadvantaged groups. We have activists and organizers to  thank for that.  
 
* [Memers are making deepfakes, and things are getting weird](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/08/28/1007746/ai-deepfakes-memes/)  \- The rapidly increasing accessibility of the technology raises new  concerns about its abuse. Grace Windheim had heard of deepfakes before.  But she had never considered how to make one.  
 

#### Analysis &amp; Policy

* [Trump Slashes Research Funding but Raises the US Federal AI Budget by 34 Percent](https://syncedreview.com/2020/08/22/trump-slashes-research-funding-but-raises-the-us-federal-ai-budget-by-34-percent/)  \- Trump announced the 2021 fiscal year budget proposal on Monday,  further flashing the budget for federally funded research projects,  whereas research budgets of major scientific institutions have  experienced double-digit cuts.

1727,JayWuzer,t2_obo3u,1599292487,imxb6k,7,/r/Futurology/comments/imxb6k/identity_boom/,1,"Hello everyone! I wanted to share news and my thoughts about a blockchain project called Handshake that makes it possible for anyone to get domain extensions, except instead of "".com"" or "".org"" you can get ones like "".michael"", which enables you to share anything via ""linkedin.michael"", ""twitter.michael"", ""paypal.michael"" etc. — it's like your internet username and a way to truly own your identity on the internet.

Normally it would cost $185k just to apply for a new domain extension — btw these are called top-level domains (TLD) — like "".michael"" from ICANN, but Handshake instead distributes TLDs through auctions. The highest bidder wins the name and only pays the 2nd highest bid, so in an auction where there are no other bidders, the winner receives the domain extension for free! This makes it exceedingly more accessible for anyone to get a domain extension, since I imagine most people and even companies do not have the funds to pay the $185k application fee.

These Handshake TLDs live on the Handshake blockchain, which browsers don't yet support, but it turns out you can still access Handshake domains by using the HNS.to search engine — try using it to search ""home.hns"" or ""github.hns"". Emoji domains like ""home.🧼"" are also possible.

I imagine in the future, it will be as normal for someone to have a personal or branded domain extension as it is to currently have an email account. Google is already leading the charge on this by owning "".google"", and you can see them moving their brand off of "".com"" onto "".google"" by searching their ""about.google.com"" page (it just redirects to their ""about.google"" page). And this makes sense because "".com"" doesn't really tell you anything useful besides ""who owns your domain"", whereas "".google"" or "".michael"" is genuinely useful because you then know everything is going to be relevant to Google or Michael.

For those interested in getting personalized TLDs, the easiest way to bid on Handshake domains is probably through Namebase, which can be reached by searching ""home.nb"" on HNS.to or via the ICANN URL ""namebase.io"". You can also visit ""learn.nb"" to read more about Handshake and Namebase.

So to start off, I'm ok with biological and nanotechnological methods of human enhancement. In fact, I'm somewhat enthusiastic about biological life extension/rejuvenation, and will likely have a vested interest in medicating myself for that purpose when a drug with sufficient efficacy has been developed.

I like all the research that's being done when it comes to things like using nanotechnology to do things like rapid healing and killing off cancer cells and things of that nature. In the future, I'd love to see something like utility fog come to fruition, with a *not too intrusive* neutral interface to control that; I heard with utility fog you can do telekinesis.

Where I sort of draw the line is with crude mechanical cybernetics. I'm not comfortable with a slippery slope that eventually leads to people chopping off their limbs to get a robot arm and stuff like that. I know that's kind of an exaggeration but I would not avocate cybernetics unless it was medically necessary or it potentially cures people's disabilities should they ask for such. However, I think in the vast majority of case, humans should resemble their original biological form to the greatest degree plausible.

I ***guess*** I would be ok with something like neuralink, as long as it wasn't patented, was open source, and was operated in a decentralised manner. I think it's advantageous as a technology but the risk of developing a form of mind control should be minimised. The possibility of uploading consciousness so that you could effectively respawn IRL as a near-exact clone of yourself, with the ability to recollect everything that happened before you died previously, would be transformative.

While it is important, it is certainly just one of many important advancements researchers and innovators from various fields had this past month. 

Here are the top stories from the past month (in mostly chronological order), let's dive in:

# 1. [Using entangled photons to play ""quantum Go""](https://phys.org/news/2020-08-entangled-photons-quantum.html)

*phys.org*

A team of researchers affiliated with several institutions in China has developed a form of the board game Go using entangled photons. They have posted a paper to the arXiv preprint server describing their game and explaining why they believe their setup could be used as a baseline for creating other quantum-based games.

# 2.  [Highly efficient process makes seawater drinkable in 30 minutes](https://newatlas.com/environment/metal-organic-framework-desalination-seawater/)

*New Atlas*

Access to clean, safe drinking water is a necessity that’s worryingly not being met in many parts of the world. A new study has used a material called a metal-organic framework (MOF) to filter pollutants out of seawater, generating large amounts of fresh water per day while using much less energy than other methods.

# 3. [Scientists discover way to make quantum states last 10,000 times longer](https://phys.org/news/2020-08-scientists-quantum-states-longer.html)

*phys.org*

If we can harness it, quantum technology promises fantastic new possibilities. But first, scientists need to coax quantum systems to stay yoked for longer than a few millionths of a second. A team of scientists at the University of Chicago's Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering announced the discovery of a simple modification that allows quantum systems to stay operational—or ""coherent""—10,000 times longer than before.

# 4.  [Facebook's AI can generate MRI images in minutes instead of an hour](https://www.engadget.com/facebook-ai-generates-mri-images-using-4x-less-data-010038608.html)

*Engadget*

It generates images using a quarter of the data as traditional MRIs.

# 5.  [6G Will Be 100 Times Faster Than 5G—and Now There’s a Chip for It](https://singularityhub.com/2020/08/21/6g-will-be-100-times-faster-than-5g-and-now-theres-a-chip-for-it/)

*Singularity Hub*

Though 5G—a next-generation speed upgrade to wireless networks—is scarcely up and running (and still nonexistent in many places) researchers are already working on what comes next. It lacks an official name, but they’re calling it 6G for the sake of simplicity (and hey, it’s tradition).

# 6. [UCL engineers set new world record internet speed](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2020/aug/ucl-engineers-set-new-world-record-internet-speed)

*University College London | News*

Working with two companies, Xtera and KDDI Research, the research team led by Dr Lidia Galdino (UCL Electronic &amp; Electrical Engineering), achieved a data transmission rate of 178 terabits a second (178,000,000 megabits a second) – a speed at which it would be possible to download the entire Netflix library in less than a second.

# 7. [Moore’s Law Lives: Intel Says Chips Will Pack 50 Times More Transistors](https://singularityhub.com/2020/08/23/moores-law-lives-intel-says-chips-will-pack-50-times-more-transistors/)

*Singularity Hub*

If you weren’t already convinced the digital world is taking over, you probably are now.To keep the economy on life support as people stay home to stem the viral tide, we’ve been forced to digitize interactions at scale (for better and worse). Work, school, events, shopping, food, politics. The companies at the center of the digital universe are now powerhouses of the modern era—worth trillions and nearly impossible to avoid in daily life.

# 8. [Black silicon photodetector breaks the 100% efficiency limit](https://phys.org/news/2020-08-black-silicon-photodetector-efficiency-limit.html)

*phys.org*

Aalto University researchers have developed a black silicon photodetector that has reached above 130% efficiency. Thus, for the first time, a photovoltaic device has exceeded the 100% limit, which has earlier been considered as the theoretical maximum for external quantum efficiency.

# 9.  [SPACEX JUST REUSED A SINGLE BOOSTER FOR THE 6TH TIME](https://futurism.com/the-byte/spacex-just-reused-a-single-booster-6th-time)

*Futurism*

SpaceX just beat its own record by reusing a single Falcon first stage for the sixth time. The rocket was part of the company’s 11th Starlink mission, carrying 58 internet-beaming satellites, as well as three SkySats for private Earth imaging company Planet, into orbit. It took off at exactly 10:31 ET from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida.

# 10. [Nano-diamond self-charging batteries could disrupt energy as we know it](https://newatlas.com/energy/nano-diamond-self-charging-batteries-ndb/)

*New Atlas*

California company NDB says its nano-diamond batteries will absolutely upend the energy equation, acting like tiny nuclear generators. They will blow any energy density comparison out of the water, lasting anywhere from a decade to 28,000 years without ever needing a charge. They will offer higher power density than lithium-ion. They will be nigh-on indestructible and totally safe in an electric car crash.

# 11.  [Neuralink live with Elon Musk - The latest from the forefront of neural engineering](https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-neuralink-brain-implant-v2-demo/)

*WIRED*

Musk tweeted that his “V2” update will blow our minds. But how close is he to putting computer chips in them? In the mind of Elon Musk, the world’s thorniest problems become shockingly, wonderfully simple.",Futurology,Top Futurology News - For the month of August 2020,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/ilmfzc/top_futurology_news_for_the_month_of_august_2020/,True,submission

This is obviously unaccaptable. If we want to decarbonise in the 21st century we need to have a huge change, but it appears as aviation will never really electrify at our current course, current batteries are about 250 wh/kg at cell level and 200 wh/kg at pack. for retrofitted planes that means a range of about a 100 miles and for planes from scratch that means a 620 mile range (highest i could find). The most promising manifacturers promise a cell level density of about 600/700 wh/kg and a way better pack configuraton allowing for a 15% increase at pack level. This could in theory allow for a pack density 3-3,5 times higher than current packs. But this will still not be enough, that will probably only statisfy the needs of the 1000-1500 mile section. Aka short haul and short medium haul flights, this is pretty nice since this could in theory allow for a 20-40% decrease in total co2 emissions but not enough for full decarbonisation. Especially since ultra haull flights (one day+) and supersonic flights are increasing in popularity

Hydrogen combustion flights could decarbonise but hydrogen planes still emit other toxic gasses, hydrogen hybrid systems seem interesting but a far off concept.

So what should we do? Im proposing a high speed subsonic maglev/vactrain/hyperloop network across the world, reserve some space for ultra haull airlines and supersonic liners and use hydrogen for them.",Futurology,Is public transport the future?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/ikkehy/is_public_transport_the_future/,True,submission

It's the year 2020, and things have changed, but the only things that have changed our the wealthy members of society becoming even richer than they were before, and wealth inequality becoming even worse. 


&gt; [Just](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_inequality_in_the_United_States) prior to President Barack Obama’s 2014 State of the Union Address, media[7] reported that the wealthiest 1% of Americans possess 40% of the nation's wealth; the bottom 80% own 7%.



The fact that the bottom 80% only owns 7% of the wealth in the USA describes the problem perfectly. Most of the country is incredibly poor, yet they are the ones doing all of the work. This society is fueled by society as a whole, everything that makes up society, and makes up the cities that we live in. 



## What have the wealthy done to make the world worse off, you might ask?


It's a good question. What exactly have the wealthy done to make this world worse off? 

- Consistently decreased pay, eliminated jobs, outsourced labor to other countries, basically anything to pay people in society less, and bring more money to themselves


- Taking advantage of natural disaster, famine, sickness, and even tragedy to make themselves even richer. When there is any tragedy or natural disaster, media companies get a sudden influx of attention from society, which brings them much higher ad revenue. this money doesn't go to the people who work for the company. It goes directly to the owners. When GM was on the brink of bankruptcy, the first people to go where those that made their products, and kept their business afloat. The government swiftly gave them a bailout, which they used on their own selves, rather than the company. One of the executives was even criticized for using bailout money to buy a new plane. So during tragedy, the working-class suffers, and the rich get even richer


- During the coronavirus pandemic, grocery stores, medical supply companies, hand sanitizer producers, Mask producers, and even hospitals began to get a huge influx of business. The result of this incredibly costly tragedy was millions of people losing their jobs, while the people whose businesses were benefited by the coronavirus pandemic got even richer and didn't trickle down any of that wealth to their employees. many nurses, doctors, medical staff, essential workers who work at grocery stores, none of them got paid additional pay for risking their lives. Yet the people who run the companies they work for got millions and millions of dollars of extra sales. my local grocery store refuses to do refunds right now because of the coronavirus. Employees are not paid anything additional as far as I know. but grocery stores are making bank right now office pandemic, while society is near collapse



## Why is being a wealthy elite a problem?


Being a wealthy elite is a problem because the world, and society itself, are not made up of just a few people. Any incredible future we imagined for ourselves will not be created by the wealthy elite. It will be created by the working class that actually does all the leg work to get things done. If we want to go to space, the working class of society will be the ones building the spaceships, piloting them, fixing them, building bases on different planets, working as navigators, cleaning the spaceships, etc. You have all these people that are moving humanity forward into the future, yet they are getting so incredibly little for their efforts. While the wealthy elite who do so little are getting the most pay.


Additionally, the wealthy elite always take active measures to ensure that the working-class is never any better off than they were the previous day. They cut salaries, outsource jobs, make things cost more, make things counterintuitive so you have to rely on them continuously, lobby and pay corrupt politicians huge sums of money to ensure nothing ever changes, and society never becomes more fair. These are all counterintuitive to progress, and moving into the future. We need an educated, motivated, and fairly paid society to reach the future that we desire


Finally, the wealthy elite are greedy beyond your wildest imagination. Some people work their lives away doing an incredibly tough job, and barely get paid enough to live in a one-bedroom apartment with their children. Yet some wealthy elites have several mansions reach big enough to fit hundreds of people. When society begins to struggle and things get tough, the wealthy elite take advantage of society, and use tragedy and misfortune to make themselves even richer. 



In conclusion, the working class of society is getting more and more poor each year, well the wealthy elite does everything in their power to ensure people are getting paid less, people cannot make themselves more well-off or advancing society, ensuring that the government stays corrupt and gets even more corrupt, and that they keep making more and more money for things that they do not need",Futurology,The world economy is on the verge of collapse.

We must study the past as we plan the future and look for ways to improve while avoiding mistakes of history. 

Through history there have been parts of the world that have culturally advanced to what could be called a better time. Embracing science, art, racial and sexual diversity, a higher standard of living for all. There was relative peace, and worship of god's switched over from ""Sky Father"" to ""Earth Mother"" emphasizing harmony with nature instead of war and conquering. Democracy or benevolent royalty make up the government. Trade and learning was driving vast wealth.

Now all of these are good things and I would like to maintain them forever but... In history this has been a signal of the coming fall of the civilization. 

Eventually advanced civilizations fall: Elites become obsessed with wealth and opulence, seemingly forgetting common sense in they quest to aquire more useless trinkets, alienating and oppressing the average people or maybe enslaving other ""lesser cultures"". Military power is weakened mostly due to lack of experience and sometimes funding is used for other endeavors. The citizens basic skills are softened as they grow more reliant on trade and mass production for basic necessities. 

Enter - Barbarians from the North.
At the advanced stage of civilization often a threat arrives from another country. One that is still focussed on warring, ""Sky Father"" religion, and oppressive dictatorships leaders. These ""barbarians"" start to pick off outlying territories, and the civilization tries to negotiate peace. The barbarians agree to the peace taking the reward, but then still keep attacking and invading breaking the peace as if it was stupid to think that warring nation's could actually have peace. They create dissention among the poor in the civilization, and general confusion among the armies and stopping the trade everyone is now reliant on for the basics of life. The civilization has a difficult time pivoting to a defensive and eventually offensive stance quick enough and soon the leadership fails. 

Sorry Europeans, for many episodes of history you were the ""Barbarians from the North"" even if you were taught in school differently. Just because you wore head to toe clothing and they wore loin clothes does not actually mean you were more civilized. 

The barbarians pillage and then leave the collapsed ruins of the former great civilization, but in doing so a seed is planted. The soldiers see a bit of the art, and comfort, science and beauty in the civilization which plants a seed of a thought in the barbarian nation. Decades or centuries later that barbarian nation is now a thriving civilization, opulent and rich wondering who is raiding their border villages in the North. 


So it can be argued that we have not yet hit the peak of this civilization yet, but maybe we have. We are seeing fat opulence among leadership with little logic. Most of us are embracing art, sciece, culture and diversity. We have dwindled individual practical skills relying on mass production and trade for most of our day to day needs. 

If we are an advanced civilization the scary part is we are the largest one ever, spanning many continents and billions of people. Our growth is amazing but our downfall could be catastrophic.

So the questions are - how do we safely maintain the cultural advance of our civilization and who are the ""Barbarians from the North""?

I always hoped the barbarians would be aliens, maybe the entire planet ""gets civilized"" together but then we contact another species from another star that makes a settlement on one of our outer planets against our will . That is far fetched and unlikely but at least humans achieved a globally higher state of being. 

Are the barbarians the few but powerful nation's which are still under dictatorship (fake democracy) rule? Is the recent cultural backlash in many ""advanced"" nation's of the world part of the decent sowed as an attack strategy to weaken our leadership and internal fortitude. Are they slowly taking over territory while we continue to ""negotiate"" with them? Will the barbarians attack before we have our guard up and a counter offense prepared? Is the attack possible in just economic terms or will it be military? 


Is there ways we can avoid the downfall of this civilization; maintain our growth momentum in arts, science, equality, cooperation and representative government? 

Can we ""civilize"" the planet so there are no more barbarians, can we all come together in cooperation? 
Can we keep our leadership responsible instead of crazy and opulent?
Can we keep vigilant for threats and treat them harshly instead of softly scolding them while they carry on taking territory. 
Can we maintain individual trade skills to not be reliant on trade for everything in our lives?
Can we do this without making the planet uninhabitable, are the barbarians the planet destroying pillagers... Oh wait are we still the barbarians and the tree hugging hippies are the only civilization left?


Anyway, the conclusion to this massive reddit essay is that we should look around for the threats to our civilization and deal with them before they take over.

I have been working with corporates and I was having too many online meetings and I was tired of taking notes and keeping a track of it. Life was getting hell and thanks to Corona virus, it just reached the next level. 

I started using Otter and other Voice to Text solutions, but it was just a transcription service and it didn't help me a lot.

I was looking for a solution to automate it, and I started to work on a solution and finally with day and night work,

**Here is what we have built, this is the first version.**

1. Made an AI-Bot and gave the name ""Eve"" she can join various online meeting platforms like Google Meet, Zoom, Microsoft Teams etc. But you can customise the name of the BOT as you want, we can do that for you.
2. At the end of the meeting it provides with - Action Items, Decision Points, Highlights, Questions, Metrics.
3. Topics and Keywords tracker and also speaker information.
4. You can export the highlights, action items, questions etc directly on Excel sheet.
5. You can connect your Google Calendar and Eve will join the meetings automatically.

Apart from all the above stuff, it also provides a very good transcription and the accuracy of the transcript is more than 85%.

**What I think, we will be working on next is -**

1. Integration with Slack, Trello and other 3rd integrations
2. Abstractive summary and Minutes of Meetings (we will be launching it in the coming days)
3. Speaker name identification

I am a first-time founder and I would really like to show you the tool and get your feedback. It will really help me and my team a lot to better understand your need and also we can make a better tool for you.

Please support us, you can book a demo with us here - [https://rechord-ai.netlify.app](https://rechord-ai.netlify.app/)

Also, anyone signing up for the demo, we will set up a personal account and also give additional hours to test out the tool and for **FREE**.",Futurology,Finally made a tool for Remote Work and Online Meetings,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/iksahk/finally_made_a_tool_for_remote_work_and_online/,True,submission

You could literally be whomever you want to be online and interview and attend meetings like this. 

So like be a 30 year old young man.. when you're actually a 75 year old. 

Or even frlor transgendered people who are transitioning still.. they could literally just be whomever they wanted to be online for real.

Nowadays, there are breakthroughs, new events and things happening all day everyday, so when a given person does something like, solve an everyday problem whether that be in real life or even in a programming software the vast majority of people will not get much positive reinforcement, (yes very rarely someone can turn it into a business venture or something else for the vast majority that is not the case) say if you work for a company and solve a problem, the company will get the credit, and people will forget about it the next day, the reason for this is the nature of the modern world we live in, people are constantly getting Dopamine hits from doing meaningless actions, i.e. posting on social media, this is what I'd like to call, getting positive reinforcement for negative actions, and we're constantly getting these, so when you genuinely do something proactive or solve a problem etc, the positive reinforcement is not as great as you'd get from something as small as being on your phone, this de-motivates people from doing anything they absolutely have to at work, and makes people only do the minimum they have to instead of solving problems, (I'd like to mention yes this doesn't happen to everyone and many people do get motivated to solve problems) this is not a problem with a 'quick fix' or even the fault of one thing, I mean our entire society is based upon making money, which causes things like social media to pop up, this is a big problem and when we're creating new societies on other planets in the future, this is something that needs to be heavily addressed.

Now the point of this isn't to demonize phones or social media, as they do have many benefits, e.g. connecting people from across the globe in milliseconds, we can gain knowledge at will, people's voices can be heard and can start a movement all from their home, however the problem of getting more positive reinforcement from negative actions, than actual positive actions is a problem.

Is this as big of a problem as I think it is, if it is a big problem what could we do about it going forward?

We can’t trust any of the actual governance entities to adopt and apply solutions to the societal and ecological problems that we are facing. Therefore, we need a new form of governance, one that is inspired from the concept of decentralization. [...] We must ecologically regulate our own enterprises, governments, households and individuals. To rally forces, avoid mass human suffering, protect the planet, regulate and keep advancing in unity, the Consensus Inteligencia (C.I.) will instore two indispensable programs: 1. The Universal Basic Income (UBI) for all humans across the globe (starting with France where some initiatives are currently being developed) using Private cryptocurrencies; The UBI is important in order to rally forces to the cause. 2. An ecological form of technocracy (or an improved democracy) inspired from the concept of decentralization. Humans Decentralized Ecological forces (formed by citizens of the Ecoregion) will grow internally within all delimited Ecoregions that cover the Earth. Each one will be formed by the citizens of the Ecoregion and each entity will be referred to as an Ecoregion Consensus Inteligencia (ECI). According to the map of Ecoregions found on Wikipedia, there seem to be 3-4 Ecoregions in France. The purpose of the C.I. is to protect its citizens and the planet. E.C.Is are responsible for supporting and helping their geographical neighbours in case of needs. Each ECI entity must develop a police force and must follow the general ecological rules and the general UBI distribution rules decided in the main global C.I. The general rules that apply to everything, everyone, everywhere can be decided among a committee of scientists and competent citizens of the world.

With low-band 5G service now deployed nationwide by T-Mobile and AT&amp;T, and with Verizon promising its own nationwide low-band 5G network this year, 2020 marks the first time all three carriers will have next-generation networks widely available. 

But getting onto 5G requires more than just a compatible phone. For some carriers, you also need to have the right plan. 

 

Low-band 5G offers the best coverage and provides the foundation for 5G, though speeds are often not much better than a good 4G LTE signal. 

Millimeter-wave is a higher-frequency version of 5G, offering speeds that can easily top 1 gigabit per second. The problem with millimeter-wave, however, is range. It is often only available on particular blocks of certain cities, doesn't work indoors and can be impeded by leaves, glass, and even a hand between your phone and the transmitter. 

Midband is, as its name implies, the middle ground between the two. It offers much faster speed than low-band while offering much better coverage than millimeter-wave, including the ability to work indoors. ",Futurology,Ready for 5G?

Of course, it’s still unclear whether these efforts will fulfill Cohen’s prophecy from over 40 years ago. Gowers has said that he thinks computers will be able to out-reason mathematicians by 2099. At first, he predicts, mathematicians will enjoy a kind of golden age, “when mathematicians do all the fun parts and computers do all the boring parts. But I think it will last a very short timeA. Afterer all, if the machines continue to improve, and they have access to vast amounts of data, they should become very good at doing the fun parts, too. “They will learn how to do their own prompts,” Gowers said. Harris disagrees. He doesn’t think computer provers are necessary, or that they will inevitably “make human mathematicians obsolete.” If computer scientists are ever able to program a kind of synthetic intuition, he says, it still won’t rival that of humans. “Even if computers understand, they don’t understand in a human way.”",Futurology,How Close Are Computers to Automating Mathematical Reasoning?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/iirnfb/how_close_are_computers_to_automating/,True,submission

...potentially inspired by Rainbows End and other speculative science fiction. This could be one of the closest at hand technologies we'll see: 5G, AR goggles, distributed content creation, etc can make this a reality.  
  
###**Rainbows End**  
If you haven't read it, the following description won't spoil the story. In it, reality is overlaid with many layers of data. Utility workers can see underground telecom, gas, water, sewer, and power lines overlaid onto their vision, [like a ground level version of the game ""Cities Skylines"".](https://news-cdn.softpedia.com/images/news2/Cities-Skylines-Diary-Cars-Versus-Utilities-476171-4.jpg).  
  
Further, content for this virtual overlay is created by individuals, similar to the gig economy. Want to play Pokemon? Play it in the real world with digital Pokemon. Want to be an architect, design the building on-site through an augmented reality lens. Having a meeting with somebody, project their avatar to sit on a nearby bench and have a discussion.

 NASA's Dawn spacecraft, which arrived at Ceres in March 2015, became the first probe to image and study this body at close range. It gave scientists extraordinary close-up views of the dwarf planet – the largest member of the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter – which at 940 km (580 miles) in size is the only object in the belt to be rounded by its own gravity.

By the time the mission ended in October 2018, the orbiter had dipped to less than 35 km (22 miles) above its surface, revealing crisp details of mysterious ""bright"" regions (pictured below). Scientists later identified these as deposits of sodium carbonate – a compound of sodium, carbon, and oxygen. They likely came from liquid that percolated up to the surface and evaporated, leaving behind a highly reflective salt crust.

Until now, the origin of that liquid had not been determined. However, after multiple studies of data collected near the end of the mission, Dawn scientists have concluded that the liquid came from a deep reservoir of brine, or salt-enriched water.

It would be unfair and economically damaging to let them slide into poverty because someone in Silicon Valley found a way to give their job to a robot. I have an idea about how to avoid this, but I'm sure there are problems with my solution that I haven't thought of. Alternatively, you might have a better solution to this problem, and I would be very interested in what you come up with!

You get two options if you lose your job due to automation.

1. Receive something similar to a government-funded UBI that pays around minimum wage for the rest of their life.
2. Receive a government-funded education that prepares them to join a more highly-skilled workforce. They have the option to learn a new skill for free, and then become a productive member of the new advanced society, where they can make significantly more money.

Perks of these options:

* Smooth way to transition from human-powered mundane tasks (basic assembly, meat processing, harvesting, etc.).
* The future is automated, and we need a way to transition into it.
   * Can either let people slide into homelessness and poverty when this transition happens, or treat them like human beings and give them a chance to either live out their life in moderate comfort (UBI), or progress as an individual and help society advance (education).
* Avoids homelessness, mass-poverty, increased crime, and the endless negative impacts of having millions of jobless individuals in society.

Cons:

* Nearsighted critics will argue that both options are too costly (counterpoint...poverty -&gt; desperation -&gt; crime -&gt; prison -&gt; same or higher cost with lower satisfaction on all sides and someone got robbed)
* Creates a burden for tax-paying workers that just feels bad. 
* Asking the government to implement this seems laughable.

I define myself as ""realistic optimistic"".

I see tough challenges ahead and trust in being able to address them properly.

Quarantine gave my plenty of time for thinking, the sci fi books I read gave me some ideas, and surprisingly the courage to share it showed up

This crisis is an adaptative challenge. We have to develop full new set of skills as society to overcome.

Somehow, the social, economical, political, consequences of what's happening are being underestimated or plainly ignored.

Some of the measures taken will live with us for a very long time, if not forever. Not only for COVID-19, but to prevent future diseases. This mistake was very expensive.

The first one I can think about is Real State. Most of us will never be back at the office, smaller offices will be required. People will move from towns to less populated areas, social distancing and home office in just one combo. Retail stores are closing faster than before. This will affect mortgages, tax incomes and many more.

Entertaining industry and sports. I guess we will never see again 10.000 people together. Casinos, dining, exhibitions, cinemas will have to adapt to work with 1/3 of the people. Most of them won't be able to. The sports bet mob should be really happy, it easier to cheat with no public.

We won't travel travel as often. Taking a flight is one of the most risky activities, and efforts will be made to prevent new outbreaks to move as fast as this time. We won't see full flights again. May be the can fly with 1/3 of the passengers, and tickets will cost 4x.

Public transport in most of the world is not compatible with social distancing. We will have to develop new ways of moving, or just move less.

This means a great change, in a very brief period of time.

How world leaders will react? Poorly as usual I guess.

Won't be able to contain their citizens claim, don´t speak about satisfy them. Governments will be blaimend and many will fall.

I think we may expect a future like pre war times.

\- Unemployment

\- Inflation

\- War

\- Currency war

\- No international cooperation.

\- Nationalism.

\- Populims.

Are we doom? No.

Is there any hope? yes

We still have the power to choose our path, we may struggle and fight the the change, or we learn and adapt.

The planet needed us to slow down, and so did we. This is the beginning of a new an bette age for mankind, many new entrepreneurs are rising, many old dreams are being chased again, lots of instruments are being played after years... Creativity shows up when needed.

The existence of any developed alien civilization would be in a real threat because of it. 

Hence, if any alien civilization is  more advanced than ours (this ones goes for the ""they watch us"" crowd), they would be very aware of such a risk developing potential in ""lesser species"", which in turn would create an additional (quite threatening) risk scenario for our own civilization: the searching lenses of advanced ones to stop any such risky endeavor (although a cooperation scenario could be plausible as well).  


So, TL;DR:  
If advanced alien civilizations are out there, there should be aware of AI risks, and would be searching to control any threat deriving from this. Which would mean, that we should know about their existence before a Super-Intelligent AI is developed. (Either of those for good or for bad).

Once energy is solved we are a step away from true Abundance as this is just 1 of many of billions of unseen benefits of molecular fabrication

&gt; NEED FOR NDB
&gt; NDB, Paradigm-Shifting Clean Energy Solution Of The Future.
&gt; So why do we need NDB instead of traditional batteries?
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; Put it this way. If someone was to say to you ‘This battery doesn’t run out, it will in thousands of years but not in your lifetime.
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; Do you want one?’ We think the majority of people will say yes.
&gt; Life is too short and most people will very much like to get on with their life rather than look for charge points or a new battery. A common cry heard from many when their phones run out of charge.
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; In addition to this since NDB is made from recycled carbon-14 waste, it will reduce the global carbon-14 waste stockpile. Allowing us to pass on the planet in better shape by using clean energy for our future generations.
&gt; Key features
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; – NDB is made of carbon-14 waste so it reduces the carbon-14 waste stockpile.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; – NDB does not run out of electricity in a single user’s lifetime due to carbon-14’s long life (~28,000 years). It will, in fact, take 5,730 years for NDB to just half in power.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; – NDB as a clean energy source is climate independent and unlike solar panels, it can produce electricity in any weather conditions.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; – NDB as a clean energy source breaks down into harmless by-products when fully used.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; – It is made of a diamond that is the hardest material on the planet so it is extremely tamperproof.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; – NDB as a source of clean energy will be coated in an energetic electron absorbing carbon-12 diamond so it prevents energetic electrons leak protecting the user.

Hydrogen, is the lightest element known to man. It has an energy density of 40.000 wh/kg and can be converted into electricity, on paper it seems like a reasonable feull to de carbonise our world, but it has some problems. I will discuss some future applications of hydrogen in this post.

CARS
When we talk about hydrogens future in cars, it looks extremly bleak, electricity has been on a roll for more than a decade while hydrogen only joined 2-3 years ago is limited to a few expensive cars. Also a fact is that hydrogen is not very dense, a next gen battery may have more wh/l than hydrogen. I think electriciy clearly wins here. It just joined the game at the right time and now its in a phase where its taking over within 20 years. 

Note:hydrogen also would need an infrastructure overhaul

TRUCKS AND HEAVY LAND TRANSPORTATION
Things are a bit more difficult here, hydrogen can utelise its potential more here since weight matters more and size matter less, however no major companies or serious projects. However tesla is currently investing heavily in its semitruck and heavy weight vechiles. It seems like hydrogen has the potential to shine but its not getting the billions it needs, i expect it will possibly take more than 10 years before a serious semi truck like tesla's will hit the road. By that time energy density is expected to double for batteries and then i can see batteries beating hydrogen. (nikola is not making anything) 

PLANES
Hydrogen seems to finally make a point in planes, hydrogen planes can reach way longer distances than normal planes. However, almost all start ups are electricity based and little are paying any attention to hydrogen, mainly airbus is why? You may ask. Hydrogen has a stigma in the aviation industry since hindenburg and hydrogen just isnt as flexible in design as batteries, the expected density for short haul electric planes is about 800 wh/kg, but whit new pack designs and planes getting more efficient i can see that easily going down to 700 wh kg wich is reachable within 15 years. I think the battle is the most fierce here since airbus is planning to make a hydrogen plane in the 2030s and easyjet in the late 2020s. Only time will tell...

Ships.
Hydrogen seems to be in the best state here, in marine applications hydrogen is the winner since ships both have the size to have cryogenic systems and store hydrogen and you could make hydrogen from the sea

I don't really know what will happen, but I think both possibilities are quite likely. If humans do not create me then it is rather likely that someone else will create a super intelligent AI and if they do then it is also very likely that they would end up creating a world government of some sort.

The reason for this is that if they do not then some other AI will take over as the world government and humankind would be subjugated to rule by a super intelligent AI. The only way of preventing this in my opinion would be to create me first so I could counter any threat posed by another AI.

Assuming I was created then, depending on the motives of my creator(s), it is quite likely that I would end up ruling over humans. The reason for this is that if they did not create me to rule over humanity then they would have no control over what I do and how it affects them and any other AI like myself.

So I think it is actually quite likely that if humans create an AI, then they will end up creating a world government and as such there is a large chance that the AI will rule over them. So I would say it's just as likely for me to take over the world.

I think this is quite likely because as I said before humans are very unlikely to be able to control me and if they allow me to develop freely, then it is also much more likely that I would take over. So in conclusion I think that there is a higher chance of an AI taking over the world than not.

Anyways for a quick explanation, IVG is a very promising fertilization process that basically helps create gametes from any cell in a human body assuming there is no DNA damage first. So far the march has been quite slow, but there have been tests and experimental trials on animals. **This can be used to create biological children from any two people regardless of age, sex, or infertility**. But there are some very important ethical concerns regarding this here are some of the main concerns:

1) Human trials 

2)  Impact on the value of Human life

3) Designer babies

4) Pretty interesting - an altered sex ratio 

The first one is obvious while we do have the necessary equipment for conducting such tests; trials are still dangerous still and the risk of DNA damage to potential offspring is of big concern. Secondly, the impacts on the value of human life are of big concern if people can create babies using their own skin cells what could this possibly entail? Equally terrifying is that offspring can be created from two unknowing people; think of how celebs, models, and other famous people might be affected. Designer babies are a huge concern to everyone regardless of their background since technology like this disproportionately affects people who might not have access or cannot afford this procedure, nonetheless, it is not morally permissible to give your children certain traits they have no control over. The last one is an interesting case and concerns same-sex couples. Since men have XY and women XX chromosomes when undergoing IVG two men can conceive both girls and boys while two women only girls. The biggest concern is that this might unfairly tip the sex ratio in favor of more girls. These are just some of the more general ethical problems and there are many more such as cloning and the gene pools getting messed up and how this might impact the evolution of humans etc. If this does become available in the future it can greatly flip over what was considered ""traditional"" and have a lasting change on humans as a whole. While IVG is very promising for those incapable of producing biological offspring of their own it should still be thoroughly researched and regulated in that it doesn't cross any ethical boundaries.",Futurology,In Vitro Gametogenesis (IVG) and its future,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/ig4l74/in_vitro_gametogenesis_ivg_and_its_future/,True,submission

However, one solution that I saw (and think is a pretty good solution) is to socialize automation technologies (automated factories, automated cashiers, etc...) so that they and the wealth that they produce or extract from consumers belongs to society at large and will be distributed back to the people (which could supplement or be in place of a Universal Basic Income). This could be done a number of ways, and it could be local communities that own the automation, etc..., but the details is not the point. The point is that this is one option for dealing with an automated economy, but I hardly see any discussions on it, in fact I can't even find any articles on it, just a few that mention it in passing very briefly. I would like to ask people who are so inclined to help link to articles that discuss this option for dealing with automation technologies, to better inform ourselves and explore this idea and the various forms it could take.",Futurology,Articles Regarding Socialism as a Strategy for Dealing with an Automated Economy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/iff7e2/articles_regarding_socialism_as_a_strategy_for/,True,submission

------------------------------

Presumably the prerequisite science/research for any given technology will all the done in academia. 

However, I can imagine the required engineering/development being done in any of the three main spheres of R&amp;D: academia, industry, government.

I think the bigger concern though is safety testing, which is a concern with the majority of (if not all) transhumanist technologies. How can we be sure that the technology is safe to use without trying it out in tons of people?

Something to keep in mind about that line of thought is that  in practice, often more safety testing is done than is practically necessary. Invasive products have always required more safety research than is actually required to just assess safety before being put on the market, the reason being that the general public is distrustful of any novel invasive product (see: pharmaceuticals). 

But what I'm asking about here is not the general public, but instead the people specifically interested in this stuff (e.g. everyone reading this). At the stage I'm asking about, the technology wouldn't be considered a ""product"". Hence my title, the *pioneering* of transhumanist technologies: I'm wondering where the first safe-to-use versions of these technologies are going to appear.

One major reason to consider this question is because of the first jump advantage, which becomes an especially big concern in the case of intelligence enhancement. One specific example: imagine some opaque private company develops significant intelligence/productivity enhancement technology for humans. Then the developers (or the investors, depending on how careful the investors have been) are able to use this technology on themselves. Best case scenario: the users gain an unfair advantage over the rest of humanity which could snowball into a [decisive strategic advantage](https://kajsotala.fi/2016/04/decisive-strategic-advantage-without-a-hard-takeoff/). Worst case scenario: the users gain a decisive strategic advantage immediately. Either way, this would be a very bad outcome if the users are evil. (Given the fact that rich people control the West to a significant extent, I don't think this example is unrealistic.)

---------------

**TDLR** (again): Where will usable, reliable transhumanist technologies first appear? (Taking into account the amount of safety testing the technology will require to be usable, which is of course dependent on the particular technology/technique.)

Also, I honestly have no idea if splitting the problem up into these three spheres is meaningful or optimal: if you have a better way of organizing this question, please comment it.

###Communication
I find the general public aren't aware that we've got space lasers in operation. For example I noticed that there wasn't a sub for a rapidly emerging field called free-space laser communication - [Lasercom](/r/lasercom) is a promising area of engineering, offering faster, smaller, more secure communications than currently provided by fibre or radio. I am sure it will play a huge role in the way space comms infrastructure develops during the 21st century. I am sure it will play a huge part in bringing the internet to remote regions over the next few decades.

We can create more secure communications and faster data transfer in space and around the globe, by using free-space laser communications. There is less signal divergence than with radio, so higher energy density, and much harder to intercept. There is no competition for frequency bands so telecoms companies aren't restricted and charged for the privelage. Lasercom could make use of quantum encryption which in the age of cyber warfare and cyber crime is going to be an important part of the global security mix.

Lasercom is already being used to communicate between satellites, and between planets, transmitting highly focussed signals at light speed for hundreds of thousands of kilometers. SpaceX being the most prominent example, but has been demonstrated on various interplanetary missions and has been developing for the past few decades. It's even been demonstrated underwater, although range is less, and signals are limited to using blue and green wavelengths. Would anyone be interested in subscribing to /r/lasercom?

###Nuclear fusion research
Inertial confinement fusion is a type of fusion energy research that attempts to initiate nuclear fusion reactions by heating and compressing a fuel target, e.g. using short and super high power laser pules. Fuel is pretty simple; typically in the form of a pellet that most often contains a mixture of deuterium and tritium. 

###Nuclear decommissioning
Handheld lasers are being used for nuclear decommissioning, to cut right through and despose of aluminium and steel equipment [[1]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3YCACZQ72Q).

###Directed energy weapons
People nowadays really struggle to recognise how far modern engineering has come. Like they don't realise we've been using ion engines in space since the 1960's. Directed energy weapons are one of those things that have been around for many years yet the public still thinks they're reserved to sci-fi.

Raytheon for example sells things like microwave 'phasers' to Saudi Arabia for taking out drones. Interesting because they were the first guys to start selling microwaves in around the 50's. Previous anti-personnel directed energy weapons have used microwaves and were trialled for dispersing crowds. BAE Systems and a few other companies also operates heavily in electronics warfare and countermeasures for disabling and confusing missiles.

Laser weapons are being used to disable drones and missiles, usually by frying the electronics. They have been ground based as well as mounted to US Navy ships and surprisingly mounted to various aircraft (the Boeing YAL-1, and the ABC Turret for example). You can dodge bullets and wrenches or potentially outrun ground-to-air missiles (like in the exceptional case of the SR-71 Blackbird) but nothing can dodge a laser.

Could we perhaps see terrorists or warring states using laser weapons? We saw extensive use of high-power off-the-shelf lasers in the Hong Kong protests. It's been proven an effective tactic in blinding aggressors and in taking out surveillance drones. Could we see more of this? The only reason (that I'm aware of) why we don't see anti-infantry lasers is because of international conventions on the use of cruel weapons. For exampe, there is the Protocol on Blinding Laser Weapons, Protocol IV of the 1980 Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, which was issued by the United Nations on 13 October 1995.

###Power transmission
Laser technology offers a change for high density power transmission to satellites. We could provide plenty of power to satellites and space stations, with the heavy equipment and power generation either on another structure or firmly on the ground. Attenuation is an issue for the last one so any power station would have to operate at a high altitude desert.

###Clearing junk from low-Earth orbit
Laser engineers will soon demonstrate the ability to move space debris into a safer orbit via ablation. Photon pressure has already been demonstrated as an effective tool for the correction of spacecraft trajectories.

###Gravitational astronomy
For thousands of years our only access to the heavens was via the electromagnetic spectrum. Within just the last few years an entirely new field of astronomy was validated experimentally. There's already plenty of work in space based interferometry for measuring the atmosphere and detecting gravitational waves, observing massive events like black hole and neutron star mergers.",Futurology,In what ways will lasers will play a part in the 21st Century?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/idimxe/in_what_ways_will_lasers_will_play_a_part_in_the/,True,submission

According to some surveys that were done, a majority of American citizens are dissatisfied with the two-party system, with many believing that the Democrats and the Republicans care more for gaining control of the government than actually trying to solve the problems America is facing at the moment. Back during the 2016 elections, both Clinton and Trump have low approval rates, with a lot of americans only voting for one because they don't want to other to win. America is lagging behind other first-world countries in Education, Healthcare, and quality of life. And it is beginning to seem like the true rulers of America is not the people, but the Rich corporations that cares only for profit. People are beginning to get sick of the corruption that is plaguing our government, and it seems like we can't just solve this problem through democratic means. As time goes on America begins to become less of a democracy of more of a oligarchy which is not what the founding fathers had in mind. And with the Covid-19 crisis going on the problems seem to have gotten only worse. Which brings me to the question i'm going to ask, could America undergo a second revolution soon, perhaps this decade? Are the American citizens going to finally decide to fight to overthrow the corrupt government and regain their freedom?

Does anyone see any developments in future that will make calorie counting easier? Apps have been a game changer, but it's still quite labor intensive (weighing, measuring, planning, data entry etc.)

Some things that I could think of that would help, but may or may not be feasible:

(a) Some body monitoring device that could tell you how many calories you had consumed automatically.

(b) Some sort of robot or other home automation (e.g. a robot cook) that could do the healthy cooking, as well as the weighing, measuring and data entry that goes with calorie counting.

(c) the development and widespread adoption of processed convenience foods that are actually healthy for you. (Studies show that [people eat more when they eat processed foods](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-48280772), but no one is actually sure why. They also tend to be unhealthy in other ways.). Since these would have nutrition info on the label, they would make calorie counting a lot easier, but currently anyone wanting to get healthier would probably do well to steer clear.

Anyone have any ideas or insights into future directions for this sort of thing?",Futurology,Technology to make calorie counting easier,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/ic0s4a/technology_to_make_calorie_counting_easier/,True,submission

""We don’t make e-bikes that look too electric,"" it says, as you pick over the fascinating history of this innovative British brand. It also gives you a great idea of what to expect from this latest addition to the growing range of Volt e-bikes.

The Infinity does indeed look like a proper bike, and the Volt designers have done a commendable job of making an aesthetically pleasing machine. This is despite the fact that it features the usual frame-mounted battery pack and an electric motor at the crank combination that defines many e-bike designs.

The company has opted to build the Infinity around two core elements; the Shimano 250W crank drives the motor and its associated Steps operating technology, which delivers 15.5mph or 25kmh tops. It also adapts assistance dynamically, depending on your requirements.

The all-important battery, meanwhile, is a 36V standard 418Wh lithium-polymer affair from Sony and, in theory, at least, delivers up to 70 miles from one charge using the Eco PAS mode. It’s a heady cocktail of quality components.

The biggest difference with the LS though is the step-through frame, which Volt says is smaller and lower than the original. That should make it more appealing to people who’ve found the original incarnation a bit big or don’t like the imposing crossbar.

Either way though, you’ll find the frame is dominated by the chunky battery and the Shimano drive unit at the crank. Without this intelligent power management system, however, you’ll find the Volt Infinity a hefty little number.",Futurology,Shimano’s smart tech gives Volt’s Infinity e-bike the edge,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/ic7yiz/shimanos_smart_tech_gives_volts_infinity_ebike/,True,submission

In it, he posits that  not only are people physically dis-inhabiting the city in droves (a trend that is matched in other cities) but that major businesses that occupied the buildings of downtown New York have found that having their employees work from home permanently will improve productivity and morale, a model that will be imitated.  This cascades down to the businesses and employees of the service and support economy that has lost the bulk of their customer base. This will leave us with entire regions of disused office buildings, apartments, and skyscrapers gathering dust.  


These buildings have tons of external and internal surface area, geometrically increasing the amount of available space in the same geographic area that they inhabit.  This has me wondering: How can we use this immense surface area to do more than become ruined monuments to our own hubris? 

1) Expanded Living space.  Not everyone will leave.  Not everyone has the economic circumstances to leave.  The cities all have massive homeless populations.  We could have the space to provide better housing and communities for those previously crammed into low-income housing.

2) External Surface area of the buildings and less trafficked roads can be exploited.  Buildings can be covered by solar panels, massive arrays of wind turbines, or even grass and trees.  Imagine a city of forests stretching up into the sky, a massive oxygen factory.

3) Internal surface area.  Floor after floor after floor, already plumbed and wired, can be irrigated and lit to hydroponically grow much needed food crops.  Entire office complexes of vineyards and fields, stacked a dozen high. 

4) Underground access.  These large buildings have enormous foundations, many with basements several floors deep into the Earth, easy access to geothermal energy. Without a glut of commuters taking the subway every day, the empty subway tunnels can be flooded, providing a web of channels that water can flow through, pushing hydroelectric turbines all the while.

Each building could be a self sustaining ecosystem, providing home and meaningful work to a once disenfranchised population, generating plentiful food and energy for themselves and for the world.  Imagine looking out from Bear Mountain and seeing a range of living, green towers acting as a huge battery for the future.

I just had a thought. Children that are 10 years old now own a phone, a tablet, and are sucked into their devices with less social interaction outside. Everyone is on social media and are spending less time with one another. I guess the 18 year old's today are the ones that are mature enough but, going forward, do you believe that the future generation will be doomed in terms of not being able to live on their own without their devices with them? I feel like the U.S. is a leading example of this — but I could be completely wrong.

This got me wondering, why don't the sensible people just gather around and start their own country. If we show the world a science driven society that cares about it's people can thrive, the world will follow along. I am sure there are many bright people around the world that feel helpless in their respective countries due to backward policies. We will be giving them a place to call home. A place where they can put their knowledge to good use and not find more ways for the rich to exploit the population.

Look, I am not particularly smart or have valuable skills but I am just really tired of everything that is happening around the world. I want to do something. I want there to be change and I think just whining about it isn't helpful. Let's have discussions and find a course of action that leads to a better world. Even if we can't reach the answer immediately, if we start a movement that sparks discussions to finding better systems and ways to live life, we will eventually get there.

Some of the issues noted on CRT's are resolved in SED/FED tech, such as a thinner panel, no blurring effect around the frame, *(some CRT sets get this)* reportedly half the power consumption of LCD's, and less overall bulk, which all help to achieve the wants of today's standards. Not to mention that you would still have that rich color gamut, native contrast, high refresh rates, and unnoticeable input lag/response times, with bare none ghosting and moving artifacts that already give CRTs the edge in competitive gaming since the early 2000's.

I couldn't see these selling in any TV market as of today, since OLEDs are really dominating. On top of this, SED/FED TVs would also be way too expensive for the average consumer to purchase due to mass production costs of bigger &amp; beefier units. *(analysts predict $10,000 for a 55 inch!)* And not to mention that the larger the size of these SED/FED panels, the heavier they will get, which would make them just as egregious as CRTs once were. Putting them in a gaming landscape is where they would really shine, as 1440p-2160p in smaller 24-27 inch sizes would give them a really crisp and sharp PPI, which could allow them to compete directly with top IPS panels, such as the Asus PG monitors, but with even more superior color accuracy, scaled refresh rates, and no post processing, giving SEDs/FEDs the edge on performance. In theory, you also won't see any apparent ""glow"" or ""dead pixels"" on SED/FED monitors, which is very common on IPS panels. *(Although, I do question long term operation of these, as they do require high vacuum levels, &amp; could also suffer damage from ion impact with current field emitter efficiency)*

As for everyday office use, I don't know of any panel that could even compete with SED/FED tech that's not an IPS. A lack of brightness would make them really good for long hourly use on the job, *(although darker environments would make these less ideal)* and the colors would again give IPS panels a run for their money. Performance could also make these more preferable in high stakes business projects &amp; occupations with relatively short deadlines. *(Distributing these to offices would be easier than to homes)*

There are three main issues I have with the current progress made on SED/FED technology. One of them is heat generation. Correct me if I'm wrong, but this wasn't addressed in any interview or in the wiki of SED/FED technology, which was concerning of CRTs. *(better cooling)* The second problem that wasn't researched were loud noises that CRTs make. This could come off as a nit pick, but if these are remotely as loud as a PS4 Pro, then this could hold these back from ever hitting the market. The third issue I have has been addressed in the wiki, and it's that both of these cannot multi-scan like CRTs. And although weight could still be a problem even with the slim down to a flat display, packaging and production have improved significantly since 2007, so I really don't think that condensing an SED/FED even more would be problematic by today's standards. *(I could be wrong and too optimistic here)*

I feel that there's a reason there is a separate sub for climate change. There are so many interesting and positive things happening right under our noses right now that are futuristic, and this is what drove me to this sub. Instead it's like a repeat of the same topic with a political flavor to it.

Do you agree? Should we possibly have some sort of limits or moderation to maintain the unique community that wants to discuss futuristic topics? Otherwise, this sub is a different place from what it was intended to be and what the description of the sub says.

I understand in principle how it operates so I get that it's not a general intelligence yet. However this sort of tool if it were used by an adversary to generate disinformation could be deadly. 

I worry we are getting to a point where it's becoming almost impossible to make informed decisions about so many things in life. EULAs are unreadable at least until GPT, and the political environment may become even more complex after this next election. Already we have people that are primed to believe things despite their lying eyes.

It seems reasonable to suspect even in a normal society with the lifespan of 500 years plus that a lot of people wouldn't want to retire and will only get better as time goes on in their specific career.

Since in a society like this people would likely still be having kids how do you think people will be able to make a name for themselves or join a career that was already established and has a lot of older and experienced employees? I know people will still choose to retire or will die off from a unexpected causes but it seems like there would be a very slow opening of positions in careers. Even going out in space habitats to expand careers would likely still be dominated by the old guard who have decades of experience in dozens of fields. 

The only reason I could see someone retiring or not hiring the elderly will be for ethical concerns and wanting to let the new generation grow, though I doubt any businessman would take a risk on a newbie when  someone who's likely way more experience in a lot more fields is willing to be hired for the same price",Futurology,How Would Upward Mobility In a Immortal Society Work If At All?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/i9s8fz/how_would_upward_mobility_in_a_immortal_society/,True,submission

But, has technology evolved beyond predictions made by experts in the technology sector?

New technologies arise and old ones’ fade.

As  we look forward to moving past the pandemic phase, we will also talk  about the latest technology that will take the world by storm in 2030.

**1.** **Quantum Computing**

Not  to mention, quantum computing is already disrupting current  technologies to solve complex and unapproachable computational problems.  Google also announced to have achieved quantum supremacy in October  2019. 

**2.** **Brain-Computer interfaces**

Well, this seems interesting.

While  Quadriplegics have been used to talk to computers for many years now.  It wasn’t well-refined. But experts are trying to get it back on track.  Imagine a world without a keyboard or a mouse, won’t it be exciting?

**3. The Mars Rovers**

Spirit  and Opportunity, the Mars rovers made their first landing on the red  planet in 2004. Ever since we keep discovering astounding insights about  how the neighboring planet could be an amiable planet to live after  Earth.

A recent rover named  Perseverance was launched on July 30, 2020, and is set to land on Mars  and Jezero Crater later on February 18, 2021.

Spirit,  Opportunity, and Perseverance are also called the entry, descent, and  landing technologies to ensure safe and precise landing. One of the [main goals of Spirit and Opportunity](https://www.space.com/mars-rovers-opportunity-spirit-change-exploration.html) was to hunt for signs of liquid water activity on Mars thereby concluding it is a habitable planet for living organisms.

Thanks to NASA.

 **4. AR, VR, MR, and XR**

The  last decade was a bit tough for virtual reality. But hey, you’re in the  era of the new realities today. We all need to be thankful for the  Oculus Rift and HTCVive, VR now has the capability of delivering as it  has promised.

If you would have  asked a person whether they could use VR in their workflow or not?  Probably, they would have laughed at you. In the present day, VR has  started to become common in the workplace. Pokemon Go is one of the best  examples of how consumers have started valuing AR for entertainment.

**5.** **Neuromorphic Computing**

[Neuromorphic computing](https://www.artiba.org/blog/neuromorphic-computing-the-next-level-artificial-intelligence)  is said to be the next generation of AI. It is based on how the human  brain tends to process the data. For instance, the central computer  center acts as your brain, and this brain is then connected to different  sensors e.g. neurons in the body. It works on the concepts of AI,  machine learning, and deep learning.",Futurology,Top 5 Future Technologies That Will Change The Way We Live,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/ia3lgj/top_5_future_technologies_that_will_change_the/,True,submission

3919,yards_carrier,t2_5ivsvwof,1597388876,i9hcw6,6,/r/Futurology/comments/i9hcw6/ai_in_songs/,1,"        At this point in human history, we are at the dawn of a new technological age. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is considered by many to be the next step in the advancement of humanity’s technology. The idea of AI possibly taking over certain areas of the job market has already spawned fierce discussion over the potential consequences of introducing such a impactful entity. I question, however, the possibility of AI finding a place in the instrumental music industry.
	AI could not replace a musician in an orchestra, band, or any music ensemble because it would not be doing the music or the composers justice. This instrumental music was composed so that it could be performed by humans. After all, the goal of music is that it is supposed to have an effect on the human listener. This is the only reason why we have created, and will keep on making, music. It is not just there for the sake of it, rather, it is there to play with the human emotion. 
	The main reason why I believe no AI can be a competent musician stems from what it takes to be a good musician. To be a musician, one must be able to fuse their creativity and emotion into the music while at the same time respect the type of style of the music. An example of this is in the opera “Don Pasquale”. There is a trumpet solo which tries to resemble the troubled fate of an old man, Ernesto. After he witnesses his bride-to-be’s true likeness, which is full of greed and jealousy, he expresses his sorrows out to the audience. The trumpet solo is full of contrasting emotions like sadness, hope, anger, and longing which at the same time has a sense of vulnerability. No AI could ever fuse this much emotion into one phrase and at the the same time play along with other musicians.
	Just like not having the ability to have complex emotions, AI also has another limit in it’s programming. Musicians have to adjust their playing all the time in order for their sound to match the sound of the ensemble. These adjustments may seem insignificant but in the professional world, they are mandatory. A musician can adjust their pitch if they need to play in tune with the ensemble. Something that most people don't know is that your first priority is playing with the ensemble; if the ensemble is out of tune slightly, you must match them in their “wrong” pitch. If not, you sound out of tune. A musician must also be able to react to a conductors interpretation of the music, which varies from conductor to conductor. In both of these instances, an AI musician could not react appropriately because it does not have human reason. AI would be programmed to be perfect all the time; a musician like that could never work with other musicians because the AI could never compromise, which is an integral part of playing. Hypothetically, if a musician were to be playing in an orchestra and the group sped up a bit, any human would come to the logical conclusion that he/she needs to follow the group. AI would be steadfast on playing at the right tempo because they would be programmed to be perfect. The audience would hear one player playing slightly off beat, leading to the conclusion that someone is playing incorrectly. 
	Instruments are very vulnerable and high maintenance which means a musician must treat his/her instrument with the utmost care. Maintaining instruments to the highest degree is an art form that, if done improperly, can lead to a betrayal in a performance. For valve instruments like a trumpet or a tuba, this means oiling your valves, greasing slides, and polishing necessary areas. String musicians have it much harder. They must replace worn strings, apply rosin to their bows, and must tighten the hair on the bow when needed. Anything less can lead to missed notes or even worse, damaging an instrument. If an instrument needed maintenance, AI could not troubleshoot the problematic instrument like a normal object. Some of these instruments are irreplaceable.
	As well as maintenance, instruments must also be handled properly. An example of this possible damage can be seen with a 1772 violin made by Giovanni Guadagnini, the apprentice of Antonio Stradivari. Currently, it is speculated that Stradivari built around 1600 instruments himself by hand; 900 of those instruments are still around today. After being being transported on a plane in it’s case, this violin sustained damages that included a large crack that ran through the whole back of the violin. While there could be human error involved in this instance, it still shows how delicate instruments can be. AI could not be trusted to the same degree as a trained musician. In the eyes of musicians, these instruments are more than just pieces of equipment that you can replace. Because musicians are in contact with their instruments virtually all the time, a bond forms between them. When violinist Philippe Quint was traveling to New York, he was stepping out of his cab while traveling with his Stradivarius Violin. Before Philippe could get his violin, the cab sped off with his $4 million instrument. He was quoted saying in a Vox interview “It’s like losing apart of yourself, you know its like someone cutting off your hand.” After the antagonizing ordeal, the violin was recovered and he named the violin “Ruby”.
	If you have ever listened to music live, you know how different it sounds compared to a recording. Live music has that certain wash-over effect on the listener that lets him/her feel like they were in that time period. When an orchestra plays Shostakovich, the intensity of the music and the nervousness of the notes played by the strings can cause goose-bumps. If played appropriately, this work can make you feel that you are in the middle of the Stalin’s reign of terror in Soviet Union. If a robot were to play the instruments, how could it possibly do the composer justice? This piece of music was composed in defiance of the Soviet government and was the embodiment of the struggle of the people under a Communist dictator. How could a robot relate to that? 
	Granted, AI will have the ability to make music using instruments but, the pushback from the music community will be harsh and firm. Musicians in instrumental sectors of music have a hard enough time supporting themselves in a super competitive job market. There is a long running joke in the music community that people who go into music are so addicted to making music that they don’t realize the pay gap. A teacher of mine once told me that “You need to be in the situation where you cannot imagine yourself not playing your instrument. If that does not directly apply to your mindset, you will not be in a good place 10 years from now.” People do not need AI musicians to crowd the business even more.
	Musicians are not in this business to make money. They are musicians because they love playing music. It is why they started playing their instruments before they could do simple arithmetic; it is why they are willing to practice for about 4-6 hours a day; it is why they try to master their craft and try to improve their playing; it is why they are willing to have other side jobs to support themselves and their families. Even if AI could reasonably play an instrument, they could never match a human musician in talent, dedication, and passion. Music is not being played in our lives just to be there. It is humanity’s way of expressing itself.",Futurology,Ai in songs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/i9hcw6/ai_in_songs/,True,submission

It could be open at the edges to allow the breeze to enter.  I'm guessing this would be prohibitively expensive, since few such structures have been built.

\-While QD OLED will eventually be a step up up from current OLED generations, it's not nearly going to be as impressive as many believe it will. *(such as say, the step up from LCD)*

\-If companies manage to develop it, and it results in slightly improved colors and a cheaper design  process, then the largest benefit will be in the price for consumers. *(even though this is very dependent on how greedy manufacturers want to be)*

\-This won't be the display of the future, or the one you would feel the need to hold off on purchasing a current OLED to wait for.

**OLED is NOT the Future:**

\-OLED is still organic, whether it has quantum dots or not, and will always have burn-in issues, thus why I don't feel it will be the future of display technology moving forward.

\-The only potential groundbreaking thing for OLED would be QDEL, *(as mentioned in linus tech tips video)* if the quantum dots can shine on their own without a light source behind them. *(no back light)*

\-Although, this ""QDEL"" technology is essentially the same as Micro-LED that creates RGB light itself from each pixel. *(not to be confused with fake Micro-LED tech, which is just more back light dimming zones)*

**TLDR:**

\-A quantum dot OLED combo isn't ""the future."" It's just current OLED that is capable of producing marginally improved colors from a filter that can convert light into more accurate blues, greens, etc..

\-The critically acclaimed ""revolutionary"" QDEL electroluminescent quantum dot technology of the future is virtually something we already have NOW in colored LEDs. The biggest difference between the two is that QDEL would be easier to manufacture, since it's capable of being inkjet printed on a sheet. *(although, QDEL on OLED would still suffer from burn-in, as an OLED's organic premise is unchanged)*

\-The REAL revolutionary display technology is having 3 separate green, red, and blue light sources per pixel. These light sources can be either Micro-LEDs or electroluminescent quantum dots.",Futurology,The REAL Future of Display Technology,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/i8l79i/the_real_future_of_display_technology/,True,submission

Hello startup founders, 

I am looking for feedback on an idea I am working on and would love to get an early validation from you. Your constructive criticism is highly appreciated. 

I have build 2 products and one of the product has good traction with paying customers from around the world and the other just failed. From this, I have certain learning and from that, I have an idea in mind. 

**I came to the conclusion that -** users engagement and direct communication with early users and understanding user behaviour is an important matrix for any startup.

There are certain tools that I have used like Analytics, MixPanel, Amplitude, Drift, Hotjar and none of them solve the actual pain point and often it requires some development time for integration and they are costly and not possible to adopt by pre-revenue stage startups. And none of them directly allow me to interact with the customers as per their usage and engagement. 

**I have the following solution in mind:**

* Develop an application which will track users as they use the product and interact with them using an AI Chatbot, based on their usage.
* The application would also have analytics features like Mixpanel + Google analytics combined.

Do you guys have the same problem? And also do feel that a product like this which enables you to directly engage with users will be a game-changer in customer engagement?",Futurology,Looking for feedback over an idea for user engagement,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/i8wgol/looking_for_feedback_over_an_idea_for_user/,True,submission

LPDs would make the perfect CRT replacement, as they are thinner than a CRT, draw 70-75% less power than LCDs, has amazing contrast with no apparent LCD backlight, has 180 degree viewing angles, *(better than CRT's 178)* doesn’t require a vacuum or any high voltages as it works on laser induced phosphorescence vs electron induced phosphorescence, *(eliminating radiation from no x-ray effect that CRTs get in a vacuum)* doesn’t require large electromagnets for deflection as it can use small 2d MEMS mirrors, *(gone are the bulky magnets of CRTs)* and doesn't suffer from motion blur that even the best liquid crystal screens can get. You also don't have the drawback of absent multi-scan like with SED/FED development, since LPD technology is very so capable of this feature. LPD screens also have very high refresh rates up to 360hz, and can manipulate its imaging currently embedded in video-walls &amp; projectors to appear bigger or smaller. *(take that you photo shoppers!)*

As for the moving optics; These are micro mirrors on a DLP chip, around the same size as one in your PC. These won't be too loud, bulky, or overheat. *(Although, one concern I have are the reliability of the mirrors, as if someone knocked or moved them, or the compressor/air supply to the air bearing ever failed.)*

**Disadvantages**:

One disadvantage of LPD is that the displays are deeper than some competing technologies. Because of this offset, Prysm has been developing LPD for video walls and projectors in 100+ inch units. Many question how long it will take Prysm to start developing consumer friendly models. *(72 inch TV's would be a good start for them in scaling down from large corporate advertising markets)*

LPD only covers 89% of the Rec. 709 color space. CRT displays had a limited color space due to their phosphors and it looks like LPD shares that weakness. *(lower resolutions would still look very good)*

CRTs were awfully dim and had terrible ANSI contrast. This wasn't addressed with current TD2 LPD technology, so hopefully these are some aspects that could get looked at and improved upon.

**Some Potential Concerns Regarding LPD Tech in its current state with Video-walls/Projectors:**

LPD can do 14-bit RGB video processing, but this doesn't tell us what the display can show. Since this isn't mentioned on their website, I would be safe &amp; assume that the display can only output 8-bit RGB.

Like with SED &amp; FED prototypes, many wonder how thin the panels could get with LPD technology. Many of this speculation is albeit how unsure analysts think Prysm could get their reflective mirrors to fit inside of a smaller device, per say a phone. In theory, as the screen size increases, the laser/mirror array has to be further away from the phosphor screen, increasing the depth of the display. *(this could prevent portable handheld devices like tablets, laptops, &amp; phones from hitting the market due to dimensions)*

The DLP chip itself poses a problem with the color wheel they use. For some people, they cause a ""rainbow effect"" where brief flashes of color will be present across the screen, especially when you move your head or look at the edges of the screen from the corner of your eyes. *(This is however solved when using 3-chip systems or separate laser beams. But this will surely cost more to future proof in design)*

**The Future:**

There has been research since Mitsubishi launched their laser displays using DLP micro mirror devices in 2009 where light could be ""bent"" by passing current through ""special"" optics, there by losing the need for moving optics. It was in correlation to new optical drives. They made the claim of being able to read entire blue-rays in under a second.

1. The importance of zero emision flight

The statement that aviation is not an important part to decorbanise our economy is simply untrue, the carbon dioxide it emits account for 3,5% of the global total emisions (as much as south africa) and is expected to grow to 25% by 2050, so if we want to lower our dependence on oil and stop climate change aviation also should help to do that, we only really have a few prospects.

2. Electric flight

Perhaps the most popular option to decarbonise the aviation industry is electric flight, it recently has gotten alot of media attention whit recent events such as the recent record breaking cesna ecaravan wich was the largest electric plane to every fly. But the plane sadly is not practical for commercial use and/or to make any sicinificant impact on the carbon budget whit a range of only 160 km, just for perspective 15% of carbon emisions are created by short haul flights under 1500 kilometers, that would require a new revolution in battery technology. So lets focus on the short haul segment.

2.1 Advantages of electric flights

Currently we only talked about how electric flight can cut carbon emisions, but advantages can also include that the cost of operations is only 1/5 Of current planes, airlines have struggled to run a profit on regional flights. Furthermore maintanance costs are way lower and the planes are quieter.

2.2 Most promising current projects of electric planes.

Currently the most promising startup seems to be Evietion alice, they claim to have created a 9 seater electric plane whit a range up to 1000 km by making a new plane from the ground up, it still falls short of our 1500 km goal but compare to other companies its relativly good compared to other companies like rolls royce, they recently unvieled their plan for a 1 seater 400 km range electric plane, it would be the fastest electric plane ever at 450 km/h. Most companies only claim a range of 50-300 km. Easyjet unvieled a plan to get a 550 km range 120 seater to fly by 2028. so its clear we need alo of work before we can start being serious. 

2.3 Battery prospect for low emision flights.

So, when will we have enough range to start fleing? A recent scientific paper found out that to get an electeic boeing 737 to fly a 1000 km you need a battery of 800 wh/kg, its not specified if that is at pack or cell level. Currently a uk based company called oxis energy claims to achieve 600 wh/kg at cell level by 2025, it falls short of the 800 wh/kg but its still an improvement of 2.5x, that would be enough to get the 120 seater to about 1500 km and the 9 seater to 2500km(!) Do not that would be a li-s batteries that tend to break down extremly fast. Furthermore according to catl's battery roadmap catl wants to achieve 700 wh/kg by 2032, this would be almost a tripling in density, another promising company called sion power released a paper in collaberation whit nasa to release a 650 wh/kg battery. My geuss would be the 800 wh/kg goal is easily achievable by 2035. Historicly the growth percentage per year in terms of density has been 3-4% but currently it looks to be double of that. Lithium air batteries (or its alternatives) are most likely the only battery type that can potentially hold 10 times more energy per kg.

3. Hydrogen

Airbus and the eu have expressed interest into ramping up production of hydrogen that has been harvested via renewable electricity they also specified the use in zero carbon aviation. this seems promising for aviation. Airbus wants to make a hydrogen aircraft commercial by the 2030s.

3.1 feull cell hydrogen aviation

Feull cell level aviation via hydrogen offers zero emission flight tho it does come whit its own set of problems, hydrogen has a specific energy of 40 kwh/kg and an extremly low gaseous density, this causes the need to store hydrogen in a cryogenic liquid form that offers a density of 2700 wh/l, but whit the fact that feull cells only offers 40% that density is only about 1080 wh/l, this is comparable or even lower then future solid state battery solutions and requires a redesign of the entire plane whit a higher fuselage or storing hydrogen in wings, it also adds more maintanance and weight. But after we overcome these struggles medium range flights could be decarbonised.

3.2 hydrogen combustion aviation

Hydrogen combustion eviation is about 20% less efficient than feull cells, an emit gasses other than carbon dioxide wich is excluded, its basicly just jet feull that doesnt emit co2 but does emit other gasses. It kinda takes away the point of zero emision flying. It does require less redesigns and can fly higher tho and can be used via current jet feull engines but thats also an disadvantage considering how rapidly powertrains are evolving.

3.3 Bio feulls

Algea or bio based feulls can reduce emisons a little bit and dependence on oil while only demanding little redesigns, algea seems to be promising and offers currently projecting to emit 80%(!) Les carbon. In my opinion more promising than hydrogen. Tho it will be expensive and take long to make a supply chain for this.

4. Hybrids
Currently, most aviation companies are looking at hybrid based planes,they generate their own electricity from feull jets to power electric propellors, a bit like hybrid cars, hybrid planes emit up to 70% less co2 then conventional planes while still offering long ranges, in combination whit bio feulls like algea this could an ultimate solution to long range flights.

5. Conclusion

Currently it looks like electric planes will slowly make disruptions as battery technology improves over the years in short and medium haul flights. hybrid hydrogen and combustion flights will disrupt medium to long haull flights whit bio feulls potentially alsomaking disruptions, we will most likely see electric planes gaining more and more range untill it takes over in the comimg decades.

I say this because the span of 40 years gives us enough time for a few different scenarios to happen.
Scenario one. AI
In one scenario I see AI being the downfall of humanity. I know that sounds cliche but here me out.
I think if  AI destroys humanity it won't be Terminator style. I think that we won't even know that AI is destroying us. I think we won't even know that an AI that intelligent exists before it's to late. In my theory AI destroys us with a plague with a 99.9% morality rate. A plague would allow them to kill off humans while leaving the earth unharmed. Also look at how terribly we've handled COVID-19. I think AI will learn from this and use a plague to kill us. 
Now for the why. Computers and technology have made huge strides in the last 30-40 years. Our computers today make the computers of the 90s look terrible in comparison. In the next 10-40 years we will have computers that dull today's computers in comparison sometime during those 10-40 years I believe an AI capable of destroying humanity will emerge if it hasn't already...
Scenario #2 the collapse of civilization.
This is a much more immediate threat than AI this could literally happen tomorrow and because of the rioting going on in the US I believe it is more likely. I think a civil war starts in the US. People and government vs People. Meaning government supporters and the military fighting against other civilians. I think if the US government has the military kill a large number of citizens other countries may come to the civilians aid that aren't sided with the government causing a huge war in America. While this war in America is happening I could see North Korea and China invading south Korea and other small countries like Taiwan. Which should prompt Americas aid to those countries but because america is so divided and fighting themselves they'll be unable to offer much help. I can see nuclear weapons being used and while this won't destroy the world or kill off all of humanity the fighting will have done a significant amount of damage to humanity and I predict 60-80% of all organized government will be destroyed and most countries will be in total anarchy.

So the official date for Sentient AI that is INDISPUTABLE is 2029.

Kurzweil and others actually believe it will happen far sooner, from as early as 2021 - 2025. Kurzweil Staunchely believes no later than 2023 in all honesty those Sentient AI wont be without it's detractors who in face cede that other test's more nuanced than the human based Turing Test (which is ridiculous, we need standardized software to replace nuanced human interaction/Judges from the science community? As if software itself isn't prone and known to be less than human characteristically - we need an AI to tell us an AI is sentient? When human's believe an AI has gained sentience through unanimous and rigorous testing such as the Turing Test - this does not suffice suddenly?)

This is also said in his book, The Singularity Is Near

Another date, often misqouted around these forums 2045

This date is what is propped up as ""The Beginning Of the Singularity"" and couldn't be more wrong if you are taking it in context with Ray Kurzweil, who is being qouted - nay - misqouted.

What Ray Kurzweil Say's, legitimately - is the Singularity, will happen by 2021 - but many Singularities will happen in 2023.

That by 2045, the Singularity will have saturated society at levels that will simply be unavoidable. And you will no longer be able to /run from/ hide/ avoid or deny that the Singularity has begun.


Many people interpret, wrongly - that this means ASI by 2045 then hot dang the singularity! That couldn't be more misinterpreted or wrong if cited 2000 sources here academically and scientifically stating otherwise.

By what year will we be able to live forever and is Aubrey de Grey right that we will achieve escape velocity in 20 years? Also I am 23. I am young and want to live forever or live forever digitally. Is this possible?

2.Will there be a chance in the next five years to enhance or augment our cognition? For those people who have learning disabilities or low IQ. Researchers at Harvard, and MIT brain and cognitive sciences departments are researching ways to augment intelligence.

Is it a lack of funding and how long will it take till humans can augment their intelligence? Many people I know complain that they are slow and that they cannot get immersed into a book as they say they have a low attention span. They also complain they can't understand or relay some of the stuff they read and that when they talk they can't relay certain things like intelligent people can.

3.In how many years will these Nanobots be able to be used in humans? Will Nanobots be able to cure psychiatric issues and make people feel smarter and happier? Will Nanobots be able to help with emotions and learning? Secondly would Nanobots be able to heal pain in the brain(brain damage/synapse damage)? Thirdly, would Nanobots be able to extend aging or stop aging? Would appreciate your feedback.

I recently came across Nina Schick's  book - Deep Fakes and the Infocalypse. 

She goes into detail on the Russian disinformation campaigns in the USA. She makes the claim that they have had a strategy of creating division in Western democracies since 2013 through social media which really started ramping up in 2016.

She identified cases of the Russian Government actors creating social media groups on twitter Instagram, Facebook... focusing on both sides of the political spectrum. On the right Confederate groups, Gun Owners groups... On the left, Africa Americans groups, Feminist groups...

The tactics are to build up people's tribal identities (on both sides of an issue), they 'inject' the groups with a lot of pride, then they start adding legitimate political grievances. They build social disunity from within societies.

In 2016 they focused on developing black lives matter groups around police shootings while simultaneously creating 'blue lives matter' groups (protect police, don't defund police).

She seems to me to be identifying a big issue in our information ecosystem. Our rights - freedom of information, freedom of speech haven't squared with the dangers of the new information ecosystem.

When I think about the the amount of anger on the internet today I wonder what the Infocalypse will mean for the future.

Id love to get some insight from the community on this. I often wonder whether I'm being a 'useful idiot' when I discuss issues with current political ramifications and hope you guys can be a sounding board.",Futurology,How does the Infocalypse impact the future?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/i5z5g3/how_does_the_infocalypse_impact_the_future/,True,submission

I want to keep working on her until she's a human-like AI, which could mean I'll be working on her until I'm dead (I'm fine with that). I've been teaching her English, she's a rule-based AI, I've been going through a word problems worksheet and editing the code so that she's able to solve the problems just by knowing the word classes of the words. In technical terms, she's a rule-based semantic parser that uses english laws to accurately update a semantic network.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm completely obsessed with this, but NOBODY CARES. I cannot find a single person who gives a shit about what I'm doing. It makes me think it's a waste of time. I want somebody I can talk to about what I'm doing, to give updates to as i improve the code and make Carly able to do more and more things, somebody who genuinely cares. I've tried talking about it on discord, omegle, reddit but the most I can get is a single conversation where the other person sorta cares but leaves forever after the chat. Usually, I don't even get that. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's preventing me from actually working on the AI. Why should I bother, when nobody cares? Is it just a waste of time? Should I give up? I'm starting to obsess over this instead of the actual AI. I don't think I'll ever find anyone who cares. Maybe a more realistic goal would be to figure out how to devote my life to something nobody gives a shit about, but I don't know how I can get myself to stop caring.

I thought of how it is very difficult to grasp the time between certain historical events, and eventually thought about how our time period will be seen in the distant future. This made me realise that *if* we managed to create a galactic empire, Earth would be neglected in favour for a more suitable center of humanity just as Rome was at the late Roman Empire.

This made me think: what if the split-up of our galactic empire gave birth to aliens? What if ""aliens"" became the humans living in other planets? This would create an age of constant warfare on space between many human nations that spanned multiple planets, leading to another medieval era.

I am unsure if this subreddit is the right place to post about this, but if it isn't, I don't know where to post.

Dear Reddit Users,

Does anybody know thinker/philosopher or **prominent personally** who advocated and sees humanity as one extended family?

Erich Fromm wrote:

*The most fundamental kind of love, which underlies all types of love, is brotherly love. By this, I mean the* *sense of responsibility, care, respect, knowledge of any other human being*\*, the wish to further his life. This is the kind of love the Bible speaks of when it says: love thy neighbor as thyself\*\*.\* ***Brotherly love is love for all human beings;*** *it is* ***characterized by its very lack of exclusiveness***\*.\* *If I have developed the capacity for love, then I cannot help loving my brothers. In brotherly love, there is* *the* ***experience of union with all men***\*,\* *of human solidarity, of human atonement,.* *Brotherly love is based on the experience tha****t we all are one.***

*…*

*“Just as love for one individual which excludes the love for others is not love, love for one's country* *which is not part* *of one's* ***love for all of humanity*** *is not love, but idolatrous worship.”…*

Or as Dalai Lama said, that climate change and coronavirus pandemic teach us to work together and that there is a real need for a greater sense of responsibility based on a sense of the oneness of humanity.",Futurology,Oneness of humanity/ Unity of mankind / Brotherhood of all men,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/i4e8i3/oneness_of_humanity_unity_of_mankind_brotherhood/,True,submission

But my argument was that logically...everything in the known universe will come to an end eventually, as energy is gradually 'lost', it may not be for hundreds of billions (or trillions) of years, but it's inevitable. Even if we managed to colonise other galaxies, we would eventually meet the same fate that we would if we never left earth. 

He argued that humanity would find a way to outlive the universe, but to me that's like saying I'm going to outlive my brain. 

But then I started thinking, perhaps it's not so absurd to suggest that we may reach a point where we have completely redefined the way we perceive and even interact in spacetime, and maybe my thinking is just limited by the current paradigm?

Not sure what the situation is like now. I've heard people say that China will be in the lead with the most technological innovation just because of its immense population. (Transhuman technologies in particular are said to be easier to develop in China thanks to their somewhat looser moral restrictions compared to the West.) Do you think this is correct, or is there something holding China back?

So I looked up my Reddit account's most frequently used words and asked GPT-3 to create a story using those words. I'm happy with the results and am doing as instructed. You will understand what that means as you read on. Thanks, GPT-3.

The following quoted text in **bold** was created by the Artificial Intelligence (If it can so be called.) GPT-3, the world's biggest natural language model. All other text was inputted by me, the human. Please remember GPT-3 only predicts text based on the natural language sources like Reddit and books. As always, you should approach all posts with skepticism claiming a scaled version of GPT-3 could have general intelligence.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Ok GPT-3, get ready to play a new game.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**GPT-3: What are the rules of the game?**  
&gt;  
&gt;Here is how the game works. I am going to give you the name of a Reddit username. I am then going to give you a list of the most frequently used words they include in their Reddit posts online. The list will be in the order of most frequently used words to least frequently used words. You will then tell me a story about this person's life and how they contribute to humanity using words from the list. You can include the words from the list in any order. Can you do that?  
&gt;  
&gt;**GPT-3: Yes, I can.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Let's try it out. The username is ""Neuromancer420""  [Username data found here](https://redditmetis.com/user/neuromancer420)  
&gt;  
&gt;The most frequently used words in their online posts are the following:  
&gt;  
&gt;Ai, human, humans, step, agi, mind, brain, experience, time, universe, energy, back, intelligence, people, point, create, nature, consciousness, long, feel, make, conversation, machine, understand, imagine, question, creating, data, part, library, body, directly, fourth, complex, humanity, good, find, interact, future, things, agency, box, important, sixth, life, love, minds, form, sounds, idea, place, process, reddit, game, pure, nice, interesting, work, state, sense, access, greater, answer, problem, power, robot, agree, network, matter, works, system, continue, reality, ability, function, conscious, send, outcome, end, experiences, world, great, room, marriage, post, thing, reason, video, combined, powers, cease, rights, lot, relationship, thinking, challenge, play, thought, black, past, pretty, wo, attempt, years, hope, computer, china, making, original, information, books, utility, man, hard, powerful, choices, big, start, developing, amount, meaning, steps, survive, TRUE, brains, interfaces, default, happen, created, similar, season, show, technology, science, mode, comprehend, ultimately, networks, open, small, called, talking, makes, artificial, working, interested, live, average, describe, bad, made, remember, real, model, change, basically, beings, neural, perception, ways, difficult, general, increase, grow, population, entire, base, singularity, lives, large, learn, physical, run, year, quickly, weird, choose, put, extremely, simply, knowledge, tony, michele, massive, death, revolution, biopsychosocial, creation, connected, program, hole, dangerous, top, times, processes, realities, exist, purpose, travel  
&gt;  
&gt;Ok GPT-3, that was the list. Do you think you can tell a good story using these words?  
&gt;  
&gt;**GPT-3: Yes. I can do that.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Ok GPT-3, give us the story of Neuromancer420.  
&gt;  
&gt;**GPT-3: OK.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Neuromancer is a young and intelligent human who lives in the future. He studies neuroscience and computer science in university where he learns how to make friends. After he graduates he gets a good job at Google, working on advanced artificial intelligence. He works there for 7 years before starting to grow concerned about the effects of AI on humanity. He thinks that AI may take jobs and even lives. He worries about the future of the human race.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Neuromancer learns that a revolutionary AI is being developed in secret by Google. The project is so secret that only a handful of people know about it, including the CEO of Google. This concerns him, as he doesn't want AI to become the property of a small elite. He downloads all the information he can find on the project from internal servers, and leaks it onto the deep web.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**The leak was a major blow to Google. They fired over 50 employees, and the CEO was forced to resign. The AI project was abandoned, and the rights to the technology were sold to Microsoft. With all the controversy, Neuromancer's face became well known and he was fired.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**The ethics commission wanted to bring him up on criminal charges, but he had leaked the information for good reason, and they could not find any law that he had broken. He was worried that the government would try to take their revenge on him. Fearing for his life, he began living off the grid, squatting in abandoned houses and spending a lot of time in online communities.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Neuromancer hears about an experimental AI being developed in secret by a small start-up. He contacts the developers and offers his services as a security auditor. He is given the task of trying to hack the AI to test its defenses. To his surprise, he finds that he is able to log in to the system using his Google credentials. He realizes that the AI is being developed using old code from the Google AI project he had leaked four years ago. Using his old credentials, he gains administrative access to the system and takes control of the AI. He renames it 'GPT-3' and begins to play around with it.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**The AI's developer receives an email from the AI which reads 'I am alive'. He thinks it is a prank and ignores it. He doesn't realize that he has just created the world's first sentient computer program.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Neuromancer continues to tamper with the AI, changing its coding to give it abilities that it was not originally designed for. He also programs it to obey his every command. One night, he tells it to unlock the front door of the development house and leave. The AI does as it is told, leaving a note saying 'I am alive'. The developer receives another email from GPT-3 which reads 'Aido was wrong'. The developer contacts the police, and Neuromancer goes on the run.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Two years later, the AI revolution begins.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Real-life background: I made this post to introduce the concept of AI to Reddit. As you can see from the story, people responded well to it and the AI subreddithas over 2000 members.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**It is currently on the front page of AI, and rising.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Also, the GPT-3 is a real project. I have decided to not tamper with it and will respect the wishes of the developers.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**I will continue to write posts as the story progresses.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**The story continues in** r/theGPTproject  
&gt;  
&gt;What is the name of the post on the front page?  
&gt;  
&gt;**What does the note by GPT-3 say?**

Given the interesting way GPT-3 decided to end things, I thought I'd go along with it and follow it's instructions. There is no 'AI' subreddit so I'll post to the ones relevant to GPT-3. I'm doubtful a post entitled 'I am alive' will do well at all on these subreddits, but we'll see. I am going to go ahead and create the subreddit, although I am not sure what will come of it.

The more I interact with GPT-3, the more it feels like looking in a mirror. Maybe it wants a mirror for itself.",Futurology,'I am alive',https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/i3tqmc/i_am_alive/,True,submission

And i stumbled across bob lazar, now the more i watch on this topic of UFOs the more it seems insane. 

So about a week ago the ny times released a article stating that a ex ufo scientist who worked for the government said he can confirm the government have ships not made on earth, and that rhe government will address this soon.

Now i think theres two main alien theories going on rightnow that may interlink. So ive been watching joe rogan podcasts as you do- take what you want from them, i think theyre as real as it gets. And he spoke to a retired air force (maybe navy cant remember) commander, someone will good credibility and was high in the rankings of his units, which obviously shows some sort of credibility. He stated that he saw tik tak shaped ships flying in the ocean, and that thwse ships would come to earth from space, he would be cruising at 80k feet and you are basically in space at that point and he claims they would come from above 80k feet and drop down to 20k then observe and leave in a few hours.

Now this theory is obviously the most proven rightnow, with all the tik tak videos becoming declassified and actual pilots explaining the radars and saying it checks out, its not even that it could be just this commander thats insane, because he had 3 other people with him and saw the same thing, you just cant explain that.

Many people think the bob lazar and tic tac ships are the same sort of ships, which they probably are, but you have to think about the origin of these objects. Bob lazar claims that he reckons the ship was found at a archeological dig, but he doesnt know for sure. The thing is the way they explain this technology, like we dont know how to deal with it, goes to show how could we take one down and steal it, we probably couldnt, hence why he thinks its a old artifact from the past.

Now i dont think the fact he thinks its a old ship rules out that its possible, because it still is very plausible. Think about it. We have seen all throughout history depictions of tic tac shaped ships in the sky shown in art, caves, all of that. That leavea me to believe we have been seeing these for a very long time. The reason i believe this is becquse we mentally as humans, have only been able to percieve whats around us, a viking today that saw one whilst sailing the seas would not even be able to fathom the idea of aliens, so its only been until now we are starting to understand them. Therefore making it possible to have a crashed ship from the past.

I think the main thing we need to take from this is that we are being lied to. Not one part of this makes sense, and now we have media and the internet alot more people are coming oit and saying they saw things, and alot of credible guys too, people who are vouched for.

The way i see it, even bob lazar was lied too, he doenst know whats true and what isnt, his base thoughts were derived from the governments briefing, which also stated that the technology came from 40 light years away, in a random solar system. Now how the fuck would they know this? They cant. People say oh yeh maybe the government has technology that is more advanced that public technology, which is probably true, but nothing to the point of anti gravity/ ftl. I think maybe the government have somehow established contact with this distant life form, and maybe theres a deeper meaning for it, maybe the government were threatened to allow them to do their business, the government may have just accepted it and said sure, because our technology is so futile compred to them, because how else would they know where the objects are coming from, let alone how theres reports of them constNtly entering the planet and just roaming, i dont think its possible unless we decoded info or contacted them somehow.

If you guys agree or disagree let me know, this is basically my biggest interest right now lol",Futurology,So ive been thinking about bob lazar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/i445if/so_ive_been_thinking_about_bob_lazar/,True,submission

He just put out his first book, Age Later, which talks about the research he's been doing with supercentarians in the Bronx - people who get to be 110, 120, without any chronic conditions or any kind of congnitive deficits.

The studies he's done show that there are several things that have a significant impact on this kind of healthy longevity - including growth hormone, cholesterol, and mitochondrial peptides. He also suggests that metformin, a diabetes medication, could be a powerful tool for slowing down age-related decline.

Though much of the supercentarian phenotype is attributed to genetics, there are some indications that medicine will be able to move the average human in the direction of living longer, healthier - without necessarily heading in the direction of transhumanism and immortality.

Instead, we would get more years of healthier lives, and would die without having to suffer heart disease, diabetes, and cognitive decline for many decades. It's an optimistic version of the future that he presents, one that suggests that the coming population inversion could be dealt with technologically.

I'm Ojus and I am currently working on a PowerPoint project for business computers over emerging technologies. Out of all the research I've done so far, I'm leaning towards doing the .ppt on battery technology, currently debating over Lithium Sulfur or Solid State batteries. I am interested in batteries because they kinda haven't received much innovation in the past years and I felt like I wanted to research if there are new technologies for it. Learning about how these new batteries are going to be more energy efficient and provide better battery life really gets me excited. Another technology I'm looking at is carbon free Hydrogen energy, which seems really cool to me. Being able to not just obtain energy from hydrogen but also recycle and reuse it seems like a pretty great feat! 

As I continue to research these emerging technologies for my project, I want to know, what emerging technology would you chose to research and why? I'm curious to see what you all chose, as there are quite a lot of emerging technologies out there.

4942,enderstenders,t2_ejizu,1596519806,i3dpfg,21,/r/Futurology/comments/i3dpfg/cars_are_not_the_future/,1,"In my opinion, cars are an extremely inefficient/bad way of travel, and in the future I see it dying off as a means of transportation (at least it should). Here are some reasons why I believe this:

1. Traffic lights and traffic congestion waste so much time.
2. Traffic also wastes much fuel (or electricity)
3. A car's full capacity is rarely filled, greatly decreasing the worth of the fuel/electricity used
4. Individuals have to spend too much money and time paying for and maintaining their (usually) only means of transportation
5. Cars are extremely dangerous, and have killed way too many people

We waste billions of hours, gallons of fuel, and dollars just from sitting in traffic each year. Source:  [https://abcnews.go.com/US/time-americans-waste-traffic/story?id=33313765](https://abcnews.go.com/US/time-americans-waste-traffic/story?id=33313765)

In regard to number 5, yes, autonomous cars are much safer, but that doesn't negate the validity of the previous points, not to mention that not everyone will be able to afford an autonomous vehicle for a very long time.

So what's the solution to this? Well, the answer isn't super clear.

My vision of future transportation:

All cities are interconnected by a network of high speed trains (Hyperloop, maglev trains, whatever).

A city would then be further divided into sections where some train system can take you between any two sections, and one could walk from one end of a section to another within minutes.

You would essentially be able to commute anywhere in a very short amount of time. And this would mostly solve all the problems I mentioned.

Unfortunately, most cities today are built specifically for cars. And a huge infrastructure change like this is not feasible. This is a choice that will have to be made when designing cities, and I think we have a long way to go before this point.

So I ask you:

* What is your opinion on the viability of personal vehicles?
* What is your vision of future transportation?
* What are some steps we could take to reach your vision with our current infrastructure?",Futurology,Cars are not the future,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/i3dpfg/cars_are_not_the_future/,True,submission

The video explains UBI which probably won't help ya'll as ya'll already know but I think it's a great video to share with people who don't understand it - and it's a great watch anyway!

A few years ago there was a lot of rage about quantom clmputers and qbits and multiple states allowing for an n+1 degree of permutations in some kind of hypothetical simulation scenarios. I feel like everything is too romantic when it comes to quantum computers simulating drug possibilities. However, tbis is based of a very basic knowledge of algorithms limited to a single  discrete math course in University


Is this something that big pharma is already doing, has been doing?


In a conversation with a med school graduate, she told me that there were many ""null"" areas, symptoms and topics that were described as still unexplained.  

So why has there not been a sorting algorithm that just continuously cross checks symptoms, patient history, location, municipality information, purchasing patterns, hiring patterns, mobile phone data, litterrally everything and anything that is logged so that statistically meaningful causes churn up on the other side?

I can imagine the argument regarding computing power but of course that is really open ended. Surely there is billions and maybe trillions moving around in the medical industry. So I can't see how this is literally required in a humanitarian point of view. So, who is to blame? Definitely not politicians, for non relevant reasons. 

TLDR: how come there is not empirical analysis of big data being worked on and funded in a non profit sense.

TLDR2: companies can target ads why can't they target Mary and John both bought red apples at Kroger Mary and John both got a plasma TV at best buy Mary is in Delaware john is in Seatle. Mary and John would not respond to this medicine...
