yin yang spectrum yin the slow stagnant side arguably never 100 stagnant maybe the beginning and end time could considered stagnant you misattributing capitalism with exploitation and laziness waste there are mechanism that can added like universal basic income ranked choice voting democracy dollar journalism dollar etc that can help counter the institutional and regulatory capture bad actor which lead bad policy being implemented bad actor can profit exploit society there are other mechanism that can added penalize waste food incentivize people not over produce make sure distributed given away others you can disconnect the capitalism from it incentive mechanism profit aligning with individual organize rally distribute funding where they see fit having profit layer from sale product service pay the individual who funded the venture begin with etc your bringing other issue with the current duopoly the and democratic structure that doesn relate capitalism however bad policy allowing exploitation people and society lead this duopoly political system structured bad actor maintain the status quo for them continue exploit society democracy through policy can structured break apart the duopoly you right that the duopoly ha lead stagnation and decay society the the bad actor extracting value for themselves looting america while suffocating american few time now you used strange argument style try reenforce idea you presenting can learn from the past though that doesn mean because culture society group with whatever title they given themselves the same society culture people that came with concept like yin yang could equally then say should listen everything that india currently doing because yoga originated from there why then can not say that should listen everything american say because they came with the constitution and the most successful powerful democracy history certainly more recent than when yin yang concept formed the framework yoga formed however 000 year will have the same historic context and you keep your logic congruent then you have agree with your point relate exploitation and institutional capture bad actor not democracy capitalism capitalism doesn thwart anything the exploitation that doe please look into andrew yang policy proposal for example universal basic income ubi which call freedom dividend 000 month tied inflation given every adult american paid for with flexible vat tax just using these simple lever amount redistributed monthly every adult american and the variable vat tax staple good and pleasure good you can take value creation from company especially technology company with high profit that benefit from automation and redistribute part those gain equally all society 000 year enough have place live have food eat etc enough survive which mean you being abused relationship job that underpaid then you not dependant not stuck living working there survive other policy mentioned another paragraph above help break apart the duopoly and fix the political system which will help eliminate the narrow short term year view that you mentioned democracy dollar ranked choice voting journalism dollar also ha great idea help counter abuse and bad behaviour some police require that all police have purple belt jiu jitsu curious you have any entrepreneurial experience well starting and successfully scaling business have had understand the complexity and nuance all conclusion not sure what view you have claim that the ccp china isn tyranny but there plenty evidence that the uighur concentration camp and related genocide the easiest reference they heavily use censorship and suppression tactic well which are tool oppressor that are actively used you don fall line perhaps you believe the tiananmen square massacre never happened whether you believe happened not people china aren allowed talk about they afraid talk about one example you don fall line with the narrative the ccp want you the authority will oppress you and other citizen who are falling line will willingly suppress others well amplified now further more efficient with the social credit system and it control suppression mechanism and where even being associated with someone who ha lower score will impact you well you live china edit add should conclude with that freedom democracy failsafe mechanism against bad actor taking control centralized system like the ccp ha then able efficiently implement the next nazi germany ccp with uighur concentration camp genocide the people society deciding who should leadership position government equally important private corporation being able exist without undue external influence control except for environmental protection etc and citizen being able vote with their dollar for which company organization they want keep existing buying product service from them then adding capitalism allows the best leader lead and successful based society voting for them buying their service product over other competing product service proof point they deserve the revenue profit they allocating and not simply placed into role they not adequately experienced competent understand the nuance specific domain expertise freedom democracy capitalism most efficient way for innovation occur technological and otherwise and most efficient way counter the attempt bad actor who want takeover and control system who inevitably are selfish and harm anyone who threatens their position control power that they generally haven earned but used violence and manipulation gain and then maintain threaten the narrative that they want the population under their control believe follow these mechanism also make sure that everyone the society the same page educated enough understand taken care well and one left behind they continue vote maintain the current system that are treating them well one would consciously knowingly vote for politician that would implement system that hurt them and system like the ccp where you can say anything outside the narrative the ccp want you say especially about the ccp itself then you can even safely voice your grievance
