21,RepzCS,t2_4chmbx83,"I’m confident that we dont have to worry about the future. Capitalism always finds profitable solutions to whatever crisis we are in. 

Hopefully we find the breakthrough in fusion powerplant, and we can mass produce them. And if we were able to transfer much energy through lazer, we could make powerplant not on earth. 

Just like NASA invented small camera that we have in phones today, I believe SpaceX will find a solutions to remove radiation on mars, what we can use to clean up on earth as well.

New York have 11 million people, where only 8,4 million actually lives in there. 

If we take worlds population 8,7B shared by 8,4M (new york) we get ~930, what means we need 930 new york city size to fit entire world population today. (If I remember correctly, I did that math very long time ago).

Elon Musk’s brother are running a company that are about mass producing vegetables in a very tiny area. 

And soon, all nations can come together to make world largest AI waste landfill, where we use technology to detect what material things are made off in order to sort things faster. 

And fossil fuel engines on car are becoming more and more fuel-efficient, hopefully we come to a X factor where using fossil fuel for somethings isnt that bad anymore.",1600620010,g5zwxpc,t1_g5zv2u0,/r/elonmusk/comments/iq1en3/why_are_they_attacking_elon_musk_so_much/g5zwxpc/,1,elonmusk,comment

# Backstory

When I saw Elon Musk tear up on 60 Minutesfacing the verbal assault from one of his heroes — Apollo astronaut Gene Cernan — I knew what I had to do.

It has taken a bit of effort over the past months, but today I gave this to Elon and all of the SpaceX team, and it was very well received.


When I saw 60 Minutes, my first thought was to get Gene Cernan (the last man to walk on the moon) to visit SpaceX as Elon had implored. I have been buying space artifactsfrom Gene over the past year and knew how to reach him. I tried to encourage him to visit SpaceX, but to no avail. So I flew out to talk to him face to face. I waited until SpaceX became the first private company to bring a spacecraft back from orbit, and the first to bring cargo to the space station, and the first to bring science experiments back. I also gathered signatures and congratulatory sentiments from the other Apollo heroes first.

Some, like Charlie Duke and Al Bean, were effusive in their praise of SpaceX and the next generation of space explorers. Charlie Duke was excited about a future mission to Mars. Al Bean spent 20 minutes writing rough drafts and crafting each word of his message with the SpaceX team in mind.

Then I approached Gene Cernan, and held my breath. I figured it would be a bit more difficult to break from the social proof of his esteemed colleagues. And so he listened. As with every Apollo astronaut who signed this photo, I was able to talk about SpaceX and answer his questions. Gene was interested in who financed SpaceX — what big money interests got it going. I told him that Elon Musk personally financed the company for all of its first $100 million, when no one else would bet on the venture, and he saw it through thick and thin, including the first three launches of the Falcon 1, all of which failed spectacularly. As I told him these stories of heroic entrepreneurship, I could see his mind turning. He found a reconciliation: “I never read any of this in the news. Why doesn’t the press report on this?”

Cernan was the last hold out. Neil Armstrong wrote a strongly worded letter to 60 Minutes saying that he was taken out of context. The program editor agreed: ""Armstrong wrote us to say we had not been complete in our description of his testimony. He's right.

&gt;Armstrong is, arguably, the greatest explorer of the 20th Century. I suspect he has admiration for anyone in science or business who sees new possibilities. He may not be confident in a particular federal policy, but I imagine Neil Armstrong stands squarely on the side of those who dare to dream.""

It seems like a good time to raise a glass to those who think different.

As for Jeff Bezos, it can be argued that he doesn't take a proactive enough role in changing the world for the better. Most billionaires like him just have a ""one-and-done"" business which is the source of their wealth. The way Elon is different is that he has always dumped all of his assets back into his companies: the 21/22 million from the Zip2 sale went into the X.com/Paypal online banking, then all of the money from that went into SpaceX and Tesla. He doesn't actually have any wealth that is not stock in his companies. He literally takes out loans that use his stock as collateral to buy wealthy-person things.

&gt;The pending launch ignited Musk’s salesman instincts. He wanted to show the public what his tireless workers had accomplished and drum up some excitement around SpaceX. Musk decided to unveil a prototype of Falcon 1 to the public in December 2003. The company would haul the seven-story-high Falcon 1 across the country on a specially built rig and leave it—and the SpaceX mobile launch system—outside of the Federal Aviation Administration’s headquarters in Washington, D.C. An accompanying press conference would make it clear to Washington that a modern, smarter, cheaper rocket maker had arrived.

191,skpl,t2_dleh1,"Thanks for pointing to it. There's a lot more details in this one.

&gt;Washington snubbed Musk just as it had Beal. The establishment—the large contractors, members of Congress, even many in NASA—saw him as just another multimillionaire with a toy space company. A dilettante who couldn’t possibly succeed. Few took Musk seriously.

&gt;“At the beginning, we had to beg NASA to even pay attention,” recalled Lawrence Williams, SpaceX’s vice president of strategic relations at the time.

&gt;By the end of 2003, Musk decided that if NASA wouldn’t come to him, he would go to it. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was preparing to celebrate the hundredth anniversary of the Wright Brothers’ first powered flight with a party at the National Air and Space Museum, and Musk decided he’d show up—and bring his new rocket.

&gt;For the event, SpaceX loaded the seven-story rocket onto the back of a custom trailer and hauled it cross-country to Washington, DC. With a police escort, it paraded down Independence Avenue, along the National Mall, hallowed ground that had been witness to myriad spectacles, marches, protests. But it had never seen anything quite like this.

&gt;As Musk, then thirty-two years old, parked his rocket outside the headquarters of the FAA, tourists who were headed to the National Air and Space Museum stopped to gawk at the streetside exhibit, even in the freezing temperatures. A shiny, white missile that stretched seven stories long, squatting in the real estate usually reserved for hot dog vendors. A cabbie stopped, agog, as the trailer took up an entire lane of traffic—at rush hour. The spectacle was pure Silicon Valley swagger, like an Apple product unveiling, but before Steve Jobs had perfected the art of hyping a new gadget to the masses.

&gt;...\*details about the press event*...

&gt;And so this spectacle on the National Mall was more than just a debut for his new rocket. It was a warning shot to such companies as Lockheed Martin and Boeing. Beal had not been able to break their vise grip on the industry. But Musk was armed with a new rocket, and a newly minted fortune that he was ready to burn.

&gt;He was coming for them.",1600582533,g5xufgn,t1_g5xgteu,/r/elonmusk/comments/iw0q87/that_time_elon_musk_drove_a_rocket_to_washington/g5xufgn/,39,elonmusk,comment

Paid off a house, brought my credit up from 300s to almost 800, and paid off 6 figure medical debt (yay murica.)

I was laid up almost a year before i got that job while my wife worked 2 jobs as we continued to fall behind.

I somehow along the way discovered personal financing and investing books.  Then business and real estate investing books along with it.

That shit sucked and I'm far from rich but I'm comfortably making my way to early retirement.  My only bad debt will be a $650mo mortgage pretty soon.  If things keep going the way i hope i won't even have bills besides cellphones and internet in 5 years.

After that I'll basically be free to just gamble with investments or blindly throw money darts at the board and keep whatever sticks.

I was raised to work hard.  Harder than anyone around me.  It wasn't bad advice.  Just old advice.  I'm proud of the work I've done and it's made it boatloads easier to turn that work ethic from swinging hammers and wrenches into book/real life experiences investing.

It's okay to work hard.  As long as you have a good reason for it and don't get burned out.

I can tell you that I've had a lot of jobs earlier in life.  Lived a few short spans in cities even.

But i learned more in a few months of reading personal finance and investing books than i ever would have in school.

Da fuck?

*  Zip2 - Founded and did all of the original coding behind the service himself.

* Paypal - Founded one of the two companies that would merge and later go on to become PayPal and was CEO during it's pivot to the current service.

  &gt;The original business plan focused on allowing people to transfer money electronically via the Palm hand-held computer. But Musk quickly saw that the “killer” application would be a system that allowed the secure e-mailing of payments using any type of PC, according to Sacks, the former PayPal COO.

 From [David Saks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_O._Sacks) , founding COO and product leader of PayPal till sale to ebay, in [Article](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2003-apr-22-fi-spacex22-story.html?&amp;ampcf=1)

*  SpaceX - Undoubtedly founded after failing to buy ICBMs from the russians.

* Tesla - Wanted to commercialize a prototype called the T-Zero by AC Propulsion. As he didn't have the time to run both spacex and the new company , the AC zero guys sent him to another team looking to commercialize it. While those guys had a basic corporation in place, Tesla hadn’t even registered or obtained the trademark to its name and had no formal offices or assets. So other than pedantic technicalities , co-founded just as the [courts found](https://www.autoevolution.com/news/court-martin-eberhard-not-one-of-two-tesla-motors-founders-9336.html).

On the credibility of that story...

* **Single Source** : The story only comes from two interviews with his estranged father , Errol Musk, in Business Insider SA ( one of which he linked ) , [here](https://www.businessinsider.co.za/how-elon-musks-family-came-to-own-an-emerald-mine-2018-2) and [here](https://www.businessinsider.co.za/elon-musk-sells-the-family-emeralds-in-new-york-2018-2).

424,skpl,t2_dleh1,"&gt;Has he actually made any considerable progress on the brain implants that wasn't already there?

Good writeup on the integration involved.

&gt;For a device that small, the team packed an admirable array of features into it. The “Link” device has over 1,000 channels, which can be individually activated. This is on par with Neuropixel, the crème de la crème of neural probes with 960 recording channels that’s currently used widely in research, including by the Allen Institute for Brain Science.

&gt;Compared to the Utah Array, a legendary implant system used for brain stimulation in humans with only 256 electrodes, the Link has an obvious edge up in terms of pure electrode density.

&gt;What’s perhaps most impressive, however, is its onboard processing for neural spikes—the electrical pattern generated by neurons when they fire. Electrical signals are fairly chaotic in the brain, and filtering spikes from noise, as well as separating trains of electrical activity into spikes, normally requires quite a bit of processing power. This is why in the lab, neural spikes are usually recorded offline and processed using computers, rather than with on-board electronics.

&gt;The problem gets even more complicated when considering wireless data transfer from the implanted device to an external smartphone. Without accurate and efficient compression of those neural data, the transfer could tremendously lag, drain battery life, or heat up the device itself—something you don’t want happening to a device stuck inside your skull.

&gt;To get around these problems, the team has been working on algorithms that use “characteristic shapes” of electrical patterns that look like spikes to efficiently identify individual neural firings. The data is processed on the chip inside the skull device. Recordings from each channel are filtered to root out obvious noise, and the spikes are then detected in real time. Because different types of neurons have their characteristic ways of spiking—that is, the “shape” of their spikes are diverse—the chip can also be configured to detect the particular spikes you’re looking for. This means that in theory the chip could be programmed to only capture the type of neuron activity you’re interested in—for example, to look at inhibitory neurons in the cortex and how they control neural information processing.

&gt;These processed spike data are then sent out to smartphones or other external devices through Bluetooth to enable wireless monitoring. Being able to do this efficiently has been a stumbling block in wireless brain implants—raw neural recordings are too massive for efficient transfer, and automated spike detection and compression of that data is difficult, but a necessary step to allow neural interfaces to finally “cut the wire.”

&gt;Link has other impressive features. For one, the battery life lasts all day, and the device can be charged at night using inductive charging. From my subsequent conversations with the team, it seems like there will be alignment lights to help track when the charger is aligned with the device. What’s more, the Link itself also has an internal temperature sensor to monitor for over-heating, and will automatically disconnect if the temperature rises above a certain threshold—a very necessary safety measure so it doesn’t overheat the surrounding skull tissue.

439,skpl,t2_dleh1,"**On Paypal**

Elon founded a company called X.com which later merged with another called coinfinity, which was co-founded by Peter Thiel. X constituted half the post-merger equity and more than half the employees of the merged company which later became PayPal. He lead the company in it's formative years and even pivoted to the current business model.

&gt;The original business plan focused on allowing people to transfer money electronically via the Palm hand-held computer. But Musk quickly saw that the “killer” application would be a system that allowed the secure e-mailing of payments using any type of PC, according to Sacks, the former PayPal COO.

From [David Saks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_O._Sacks) ,  founding COO and product leader of PayPal till sale to ebay, in [Article](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2003-apr-22-fi-spacex22-story.html)

By the time he was replaced with Thiel , the business model was already figured out , the company had already scaled and was one of the largest payment providers. Neither the business model nor the end product saw major changes over that period.

&gt;not his orginal idea

Yes , confinity had a product called PayPal , but the idea isn't the main thing. There were also many well funded competitors already, such as Citigroup with their c2it email payment service, BancOne's emoneymail, Yahoo's PayDirect, Western Union's BidPay, etc. Even X had a email payment service. What mattered was turning it into the market leader and a money making one at that, which included

* Solving PayPal's problem of losing money because people would instantly take out the money to their bank account after transfers. The key to making it a success was incentivising people to keep their money there by offering bank like services. Paypal started offering things like money market fund and debit card , borrowed over from X which managed to do just that.

* Lowering their charges. The main thing that set PayPal apart ( minimising credit card transfer and their charges by enabling bank to bank transfer where they authenticated accounts by sending a small unique amount that the user had to then enter ) was also developed under his tenure.",1600274498,g5hickc,t1_g5hgprv,/r/elonmusk/comments/itihnw/story_of_my_life/g5hickc/,2,elonmusk,comment
440,skpl,t2_dleh1,"&gt;**tesla - Not a orginal fouder**

Elon wanted to commercialize [a prototype called the T-Zero by AC Propulsion.](https://i.imgur.com/nPj6twT.png) As he didn't have the time to run both spacex and the new company , the AC zero guys sent him to another team looking to commercialize it.

&gt;AC Propulsion developed the idea, and both Eberhard and Musk initially approached the San Dimas, California, company to build the car. 

&gt;Both Eberhard and Musk saw the importance – and potential – of what Gage and Cocconi had created. When Eberhard and Musk approached them individually to prod them into taking the next step and produce the vehicle, Gage opted instead to introduce Musk to Eberhard and get back to work creating the eBox, an electrified Scion xB that Gage considered more practical and economical.

[Source](https://www.wired.com/2009/06/tesla-founder/)

When Musk approached Martin , the business consisted of nothing but an unfunded business plan to commercialize the T-Zero. While there was a basic corporation in place, Tesla hadn’t even registered or obtained the trademark to its name and had no formal offices or assets.

To save legal fees, they even copied the SpaceX articles of incorporation and bylaws for Tesla. Even the Tesla logo was designed by RO Studio, same guys Musk had hired to design the SpaceX logo.

Again from previous wired article article

&gt;And Musk didn't act sooner to replace Eberhard, either in the early days when one member of the management team sought his ouster or at the series C round of funding when a top-tier venture capitalist conditioned an investment offer on Eberhard's departure (In both cases, Musk backed Eberhard). Both men have privately, and sometimes publicly, regretted those decisions.

Elon supported Martin even though others protested that he wasn't running the company properly. When it came to light he was lying about the costs of the roadster , Musk ousted reluctantly replaced him, running both companies and pouring every bit of money he had into it, saving it.

Later Martin sued to make the first two sole founders , while Elon wanted all of the early team ( including JB , who joined after him , and he himself bought on ) as co-founders.

[Judge strikes down request that former CEO Martin Eberhard be declared one of only two founders of the automotive start-up.](https://www.cnet.com/news/teslas-musk-gloats-over-eberhard-ruling/)

&gt; A San Mateo County Superior Court judge on Wednesday denied former Tesla Motors CEO Martin Eberhard's request that he be declared one of only two Tesla founders, according to a statement released by Tesla Motors late Wednesday night.

Remind me of the other company/organization that did reuse of a orbital class rocket with supersonic retropropulsion till now. I'll wait. Or a full flow staged combustion engine or a working methane engine.

**&gt;just dumps money in to the research**

&gt;He does do technical work. He is intimately involved in the design process, though I doubt that includes making 3D CAD designs of individual parts, programming flight software, or anything like that.

\- Reliability Analysis Engineer at SpaceX

&gt;Elon is both the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer of SpaceX, so of course he does more than just ‘some very technical work’. He is integrally involved in the actual design and engineering of the rocket, and at least touches every other aspect of the business (but I would say the former takes up much more of his mental real estate). Elon is an engineer at heart, and that’s where and how he works best.

\- Former Head of Quality Assurance at SpaceX

Sourced from [here](https://www.quora.com/Does-Elon-Musk-do-some-very-technical-work-code-design-etc-at-SpaceX) . I have gone though LinkedIn and other details online and don't think these people are lying about their positions. Other anecdotes can be found on places like hackernews but without profiles can't be verified.

Also excerpts from [Tom Mueller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Mueller) , Former CTO of Propulsion at SpaceX and main guy behind the Merlin engines, speaking [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/6b043z/_/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacexlounge/comments/hcn6pc/_/) to a very small group of students , where the stream was later removed , but the community saved the transcript.

&gt;We’ll have, you know, a group of people sitting in a room, making a key decision. And everybody in that room will say, you know, basically, “We need to turn left,” and Elon will say “No, we’re gonna turn right.” You know, to put it in a metaphor. And that’s how he thinks. He’s like, “You guys are taking the easy way out; we need to take the hard way.” 

&gt;And, uh, I’ve seen that hurt us before, I’ve seen that fail, but I’ve also seen— where nobody thought it would work— it was the right decision. It was the harder way to do it, but in the end, it was the right thing.

&gt;...

&gt;And now we have the lowest-cost, most reliable engines in the world. And it was basically because of that decision, to go to do that. So that’s one of the examples of Elon just really pushing— he always says we need to push to the limits of physics.

&gt; ""Tom doubted Falcon-9 could be reusable.""

&gt; ""Elon was the right guy and the best mentor.""

[Kevin Watson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rkevinwatson) , who designed the avionics for SpaceX 

&gt;Elon is brilliant. He’s involved in just about everything. He understands everything. If he asks you a question, you learn very quickly not to go give him a gut reaction.

&gt;He wants answers that get down to the fundamental laws of physics. One thing he understands really well is the physics of the rockets. He understands that like nobody else. The stuff I have seen him do in his head is crazy.

&gt;He can get in discussions about flying a satellite and whether we can make the right orbit and deliver Dragon at the same time and solve all these equations in real time. It’s amazing to watch the amount of knowledge he has accumulated over the years.

The article says they want to do that in order to save fuel. But fuel is about the cheapest part of a Starship-mission. 

And because they don't mention it, we can safely assume that the ""detour"" to Venus increases the travel time considerably. But that's exactly what we don't want to happen. The fewer days in space the less problems with radiation. With a flyby at Venus this problem would even amplify itself because of the proximity of the sun.

When ""developing the literal ground you build on"" is a huge massive project in and of itself PLUS there are no usable resources AND no water... no. 


You are just latching onto the hysterical BS contrarian idea of Venusian cloud cities, which is just that... an idea. Like, you've *heard* people talk about this. You dont really have any understanding at all about the relative strengths of Mars or Venus but you've HEARD people talk about how Venus' atmosphere would be great for colonizing with cloud cities. So Venus has come up as a topic so you'll just repeat it.


Going as far as to say Venus is MORE habitable is **full blown pants on head stupid**.

525,Reddit-runner,t2_yqvh7,"&gt;Saving fuel has nothing do with cost

With traditional launchers the fuel for the upper stages or the exploration stage takes a considerable about of the stupidly expensive payload. If you can reduce the fuel mass, you can increase the actually useful payload, without making the mission even more expensive. Traditional mission profiles to Mars call for several fuel launches on expendable launchers. Obviously you want to minimise the number of fuel launches. If you can cut back even one launch with a flyby at venus, you can easily save 200 millions on your mission, making it more likely to be approved by Congress. 

With Starship nothing of that is a concern.


&gt;What is a flyby at the sun?

Bad wording by me. I meant a flyby at venus. Such a trajectory brings you closer to the sun and thus increases the radiation density.",1600181285,g5czge1,t1_g5cvkbn,/r/elonmusk/comments/it4ej0/but_we_already_packed_our_bags/g5czge1/,2,elonmusk,comment

Starship empty weight: 117,934kg

Starship volume: 1000 cubic meters

Venus atmosphere density (surface): 65 kg/cubic meter

The density of the an empty starship is 117 kg/cubic meter. So even at the surface it would not be buoyant. Even if we pulled a vacuum inside starship. 

To achieve a liveable temperature of 30-40c it's seems we would need a floating base around 40km high with an atmospheric pressure showing around 2 bar'ish. This zone is a sulphuric acid haze zone. It seems completely plausible to create a craft that would be rigid and buoyant at that altitude.

640,DogStoleMyWoobie,t2_17ite908,"&gt;  Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System

Yes, AFIS has existed and been used since the 90s. However, that doesn't take less than an hour. The shortest time for all 10 fingerprints is about 2 hours, more realistically it's generally about 5-7hrs. Forget about hours if you only have one, or a partial print, that can take as long as many weeks.

However, even when AFIS turns up a match, that match still needs to be examined by someone for it to be treated as admissible evidence. The state cannot only use an AFIS match, it still needs to be checked, as scars, cuts and multiple other ""mutilations"" can throw off the system completely and before you know it John Smith is Joe Giorgione, not a good look for the ADA, and a field day for the defense.

714,CaVeRnOusDiscretion,t2_35folbek,"Philanthropy is essentially just a way for rich people to boost their personal branding and feel good about themselves, killing two birds in one stone.

There’s an old Chinese proverb that says:”Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime” That’s the biggest difference between Bill Gates and Elon Musk, Bill Gates is buying you fish &amp; chips for a day, Elon Musk teaches you how to fish. Al-tough a more accurate metaphor when it comes to both men’s philanthropic endeavors would be that Bill Gates is trying to cure cancer by only treating the symptoms whereas Elon Musk ignores the symptoms but try to find the source of the tumors in order to cut it out.

At first glance Bill Gates seems to be a much more generous and influential philanthropist than Elon Musk, Gates Foundation commits $258.3 million to cure malaria in developing countries and provides free Malaria vaccine in India.

Elon Musk on the other hand, makes electric cars and created his own foundation that funds clean energy research and science advocacy (see the amazing ’s answer for more details on this), which appears to be much less impressive than Bill Gates’s “good deeds”, in fact, I can’t even count how many times I have seen the question:”Why don’t Elon Musk just donate his money to solve world hunger instead of squandering it to explore Mars?” posted and retweeted by scientifically illiterate people all over the world, and they couldn’t be more wrong.

For example, China's polluted air kills 4,400 a day, India’s Malaria infected mosquitoes kill 2,7 a day, so Elon Musk’s endeavors(open source electric car patents and clean energy research) has the potential to save 4,400 lives per day in China and will lead to the creation of a lot of jobs, on the other hand, Bill Gates’s endeavors although commendable will “only” save 2,7 lives per day in India. So even though Elon Musk is donating less money to charities than Bill Gates, Elon is actually being more philanthropic than Bill Gates.

[About the Aero L-39 Albatros](http://twinandturbine.com/article/l-39-albatros-fly-fighter-jet/)

After Elon Musk made his first millions from the sales of Zip2 and PayPal, he invested much of the money into founding SpaceX in 2002 and co-founding Tesla in 2003. But in addition to launching two of the world's most famous startups, Musk also devoted some cash to his love of aviation.


Musk describes flying it [here](https://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2003/10/06/350397/index.htm)

&gt;Probably the most fun plane I have is a Russian fighter jet. It's called an L-39. It has a Czech air frame, a Ukrainian engine, Russian avionics. It's what they used to train their fighter pilots on, so it's incredibly acrobatic. But your butt hurts if you fly in it for more than an hour. The seats are really hard.

&gt;You can do eight Gs in that plane. You pretty much need a G-suit, or you could black out. I might go up to five, but that's the most. Five Gs means that's five times your body weight. It's pretty hard to move. You feel very heavy. Your cheeks are being sucked down. If you maintain five Gs for too long, it's very hard to concentrate. You start seeing red dots.

&gt;Probably the most fun flight I did was with another L-39 in Nevada. It's kind of open airspace, so we did a tail chase, where we basically followed another plane through the mountains at very low altitude. Literally, it was just like in Top Gun. You're no more than a couple of hundred feet above the ground, following the contour of the mountains. We came up to a mountain, did a vertical climb up the side of it, inverted. Turned upside down. Yeah, that was fun. It's like a roller coaster. Only you go much farther up and down.

Him on stopping , from [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2008/09/24/DI2008092402502.html)

&gt;Sadly, I don't pilot myself any more, but do have a (lapsed) multi-engine IFR rating. I have to work when I fly and have too many thoughts in my head to pay the necessary attention to the plane -- I can be absentminded at times, which is a really bad habit for a pilot.",1600028583,g55pb0t,t3_is5u30,/r/elonmusk/comments/is5u30/aero_l39_albatros_in_spacex_livery_that_elon_musk/g55pb0t/,12,elonmusk,comment

You can help yourself in your specific circumstances by:

 - Taking regular breaks (use the Pomodoro Technique, there are useful apps to help you or just use the timer/stopwatch on your phone)
 - Adjusting your work space to be comfortable, this include reducing glare, making sure your screen is only as bright as ambient lighting (hold up a sheet of paper next to the screen and adjust brightness to match)
 - Adjust your display to be moderate contrast, not extreme black-and-white
 - Use larger font sizes so you're not straining to focus on tiny letters
 - Get at least half an hour of exercise such as walking a couple of kilometres every day
 - Stay hydrated
 - Maintain a routine sleep habit — get to bed at a regular time each night and make sure you spend the hour beforehand winding down and preparing for sleep",1600043836,g56n501,t3_iqjjbp,/r/elonmusk/comments/iqjjbp/how_to_work_6080_hours_per_week_like_elon/g56n501/,1,elonmusk,comment

844,Rottenpotato365,t2_12yzks,"Gonna go on a rant here, But I love how much tesla has impacted the automotive industry and the space industry (but I'll talk about that another time)

When tesla stated they were nobody's with a small crappy factory, but when you look at them now they've shaped and changes the electric automotive industry the gigafactory is the largest building in length. 

People kept saying ""you can't make cheap and reliable electric cars with long range they won't work"" 

But just like landing and reusing a rocket, Elon and his team proved them wrong. 

Look at how many automotive companies are now pushing for electric cars, nearly every car company has come out and said that they're making a new electric or electric hybrid car. 

There may have been a few bumps along the way (I'm looking at you roadster and model S production) 

But look at them now. Tesla stock is insane and they're cars are rated some of the most reliable and safest cars in the market for a budget. 

Elon not only helped the company but saved and changed it, but he's not the only one there we can't forget about fanz (the lead designer at tesla)

Tesla are fantastic and their consistent improvements on full self driving and autopilot are basically unheard from other automotive companies (that I'm aware of) not to mention the updates to the software and adding new games and features like Spotify and Netflix. 

Also the app, we can't forget about the app YOU CAN CALL AND SUMMON YOUR CAR TO YOU FROM A MOTHER FUCKING APP, YOU CAN EVEN OPEN YOUR CAR FROM THE APP! No need for a key when YOU ARE THE KEY. I haven't even seen another car company do stuff like that.

The other key part beyond the passion is those extra house _paying off_ for you. If you work mega hours and there is no payoff you will burn out. I mean look at the success of his companies - its hard to argue there hasnt been payoff to the time he puts in. When work is you hobby its almost hard to _not_ put time towards your job.

Noradrenaline is released to motivate action, and dopamine is released when your brain feels like you are ""making progress"" or ""on the right track"". If there is not enough dopamine to counteract the noradreinaline, there is a ""noradrenaline quit system"" which makes you give up at what you are doing (whether that is running a marathon, studying schoolwork or working on some task).

944,skpl,t2_dleh1,"Old bullshit we have already gone over in details. He wouldn't waste his time on the loser. Good move.

&gt;**Illegally threatened to take away stock options if employees unionized (the judge in this case found Musk and Tesla violated labor laws in 11 additional ways)**

Stupid law and stupid judge. It's about [this tweet](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/998454539941367808?s=19)

&gt;Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues &amp; give up stock options for nothing? Our safety record is 2X better than when plant was UAW &amp; everybody already gets healthcare.

which is clearly talking about the fact that other companies with the UAW do not have stock options for their employees , which he even clarifies [here](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/999415738967277568?s=19)

&gt;Exactly. UAW does not have individual stock ownership as part of the compensation at any other company.

And to put some source behind what he said in the tweet

Same plant under GM/Toyota under the same UAW , before Tesla took over 

&gt;Under Toyota and GM leadership, the factory had an average recordable incident rate of 12.6 between 2003 and 2009, and in each of these years, the numbers were worse than the industry average. However, Tesla recorded a rate of just 6.2 last year. 

[Source](https://www.motortrend.com/news/teslas-fremont-factory-now-achieves-industry-average-safety/?&amp;ampcf=1)

&gt;**Fired an employee one day before his stock options vested**

Weird he made so much noise about this lawsuit and that back in 2017 , but no peep since then. Maybe there was a legitimate reason to be fired.

&gt;**Fired staff after promising them they could take unpaid time off if they didn’t feel comfortable returning to work during COVID**

When they were open early in defiance of the County , not indefinitely and that too without notice. 

You want Tesla to keep them forever on the rolls, while they collect unemployment benefits sitting at home, while all their other colleagues are working?

&gt;**— Has had 43 workers’ rights violations filed against his company since 2010**

&gt;**— Has had 145 complaints filed with California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing since 2014**

Keyword here is ***filed***. Or as Musk [would say](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/998372753362173952?s=19)

1064,RepzCS,t2_4chmbx83,"No, people in Norway dont buy Tesla for enviorment or political reasons. (Comment above was about American left leaning people, not Norwegian). The reason to the current drop of Tesla in Norway is because Government start to be more fair. Electric car owners have to pay for the same things fossil fuel car owners have to pay.

When new things come to market, there are lack of regulations, and people exploit it. Norway is a very slow performing government, that’s why I like German/Danish government cuz they are faster at regulations etc.

Gen X basically made British punk rock a trend so its not a surprise Coupland used a British band name.

No no Gen X is a cohort of individuals who grow up in the environment specific to the United States between 1964-5 &amp; 1979-1980 

Although I disagree with the broad range that most generation researches use for Millennials. People born in 1981 have very little in common with people born in 1996-7.

Per [CNN](https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/05/08/entertainment/elon-musk-grimes-baby-name-pronunciation-scli-intl/index.html#aoh=15996864716233&amp;csi=1&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp;amp_tf=From%20%251%24s):
&gt;""Speculation over the name X Æ A-12 has been a major topic of conversation since the couple welcomed the baby boy into the world on Monday, with questions over what the characters mean.

&gt;The Canadian musician -- real name Claire Elise Boucher -- previously explained that Æ is the Elven spelling of AI, which is shorthand for artificial intelligence.

&gt;""It's just X, like the letter X. Then A.I. Like how you said the letter A then I,"" wrote Grimes on Thursday in response to a query on Instagram.""

Later in that article:

&gt;""She explained ""X"" stood for ""the unknown variable,"" while Æ -- AI -- was shorthand for artificial intelligence and translates to ""love"" in several languages.""

So it means artificial intelligence in elven, but also love in multiple languages (including Japanese and Chinese, as we revealed in this thread).",1599686770,g4l69mm,t1_g4kovxx,/r/elonmusk/comments/ipg8ef/x_æ_a12/g4l69mm/,3,elonmusk,comment

1244,Gatorinnc,t2_14q5prw5,"How many days in a row do you sit idly by and consider only a day trader reacts in such a way?

Before battery day there was the split day. Prior to the split, people were hiking up the price. After the split, it is profit taking.

Here is the news that you should consider: 

1. Tesla is no longer the number 1 selling EV car in many European and the Chinese market. 

2.  VW is now in the game. To compete with the 3 and the Y.

3. Taycan is cannibalizing workers from other areas of Audi because they can't keep up with the demand.

4. Nikola shares jumped because of GM getting in. 

5. Tesla service issues and end of quarter shoddiness have become permanent features. 

6. Battery day reveal will HAVE to be siginificantly  overpowering in its value to negate the bad news and competition.  Competition that used to be not thought of but is now a reality. 

I own a model 3. I owned shares, made a very handsome gain on the ride up leading into the split. Sold. Will wait for the share value to drop to around 50 to 70 range. Knowing futute gains will NEVER be the same as made in the last three years.",1599600506,g4hdgzk,t1_g4g6o3r,/r/elonmusk/comments/iovn1r/tesla_stocks_are_crashing/g4hdgzk/,1,elonmusk,comment

1359,throwaway2749264,t2_5h3r0xpw,"I’ll start by saying that I don’t dislike Elon fundamentally as a person, but I do dislike him as a businessperson.

Many of the members of Anti-Elon communities are leftists, which is a very important aspect of their hostility. There’s no doubt that most people find the exploitation of labour deplorable, leftists take that to another level. My personal dislike of Elon comes largely from the Bolivia incident and his response to it and (and this is the main thing) his use of the cobalt mines in the DRC. I can forgive his other wrongdoings as I will attribute them to his inexperience in certain fields, not saying that all leftists will feel the same. 

I know that some people in those communities do dislike him as a person, his transphobia towards Grimes is something that people bring up very often (which I will give him the benefit of the doubt and assume he didn’t know how damaging his words could be).",1599522949,g4e45qm,t3_ikux5u,/r/elonmusk/comments/ikux5u/opinions_regarding_renoughmuskspam/g4e45qm/,1,elonmusk,comment

I think Elon is essentially a left leaning moderate because of his focus on green energy, versus a financially conservative moderate with liberal social ideology as a libertarian is (theoretically).",1599375997,g47lz55,t1_g2436pc,/r/elonmusk/comments/ic9867/not_mine_comment_if_you_know_source/g47lz55/,1,elonmusk,comment

I watched the video and I think there is validity to applying this argument across the political spectrum. There is no Marxist apocolypse or Conservative plague. There are opinions and positions. The best anyone can do is reference as many sources as possible and take in the information yourself. To truly do this, you must be vulnerable, because sometimes the truth really hurts... and it's often difficult to accept that your opinion can change, that something you have held for so long may be false. You must be vulnerable to unwrap the hard shell of opinion and blind defenses you've built around yourself.

Some people there think a lawsuit automatically makes you guilty, that errol had emerald mines before ergo elon is rich , that elon isn’t an engineer and he stole his ideas (that he has never innovated basically). 

I think the top post for one of the subreddits was the one on the supposed spacex whistleblower claiming that spacex was falsifying their tests (which is outside of court asinine because even if you fooled Nasa, there would be glaring errors later right? But nope)

Communism can be the failed attempts where it never actually happened and was more of a fascist dictatorship, or the never realized concept like you mentioned. Just saying ""Communism bad"" is pretty silly because it has never happened. Either way that is not what I am trying to talk about.

What has actually happened is these ""numbskulls"" you are talking about wanting wealth redistribution (better word is socialism). Also known as taxes, benefiting society. So when a mega billionaire like Bezos makes a shit ton of money and pays barely any taxes for his corporation and treats employees like shit, people want some wealth redistribution. 

He has taken advantage of the system to the point where many others suffer and doesn't benefit the system by paying back into it. I don't know Musk's effects in these ways, and I admire what he has done, but wanting wealth redistribution is still fine.",1599147744,g3uyv1e,t1_g3uv20o,/r/elonmusk/comments/ilmpkw/good/g3uyv1e/,1,elonmusk,comment

1786,TheGreatBeyondr,t2_3v9qmm4t,"BokuWaKamida explained it well. Only thing i will add is this: the theoretical Instagram posts that say if Bezos and Musk and Gates all put their money together it would solve world hunger is completely false. The western world is built upon its own giants of commerce. When people’s wealth is stored in shares, that means they must sell them to access the cash. If Bezos sold more than 5% of Amazon at once or in the same quarter, the Amazon price would be effected. “Why is Bezos selling off? Should i also?..” it’s possible Bezos selling his shares and taking, example, 1 billion dollars out, the share price impact from doing that could result in him losing 5% of every share, which would be a fuckton more than 1 billion worth of $. Net worth from shares held is misleading because it’s trapped. In Elon’s case, he LITERALLY cannot sell for at least 5 years in his Chairman contract, allowing the price to maintain stability.",1599148355,g3v0qme,t1_g3tlvzs,/r/elonmusk/comments/ilmpkw/good/g3v0qme/,1,elonmusk,comment

1837,Patradoxon,t2_3s89qt9s,"(Ignore grammar mistakes, I'm german as you can imagine) 

Tübingen is a city in Baden Württemberg (Germany) and my hometown. It's not a huge but also not a small city. Tübingen is famous for it's university, many students and science. 

The vaccine manufacturer CureVac has its headquarters here. Tesla cooperates with CureVac and Elon visited them to see a new 3D printing technology, which could speed up the production of a Corona vaccination. 

MONDAY:
When I read that Elon would visit Tübingen, I was over the moon. Elon is my idol and an inspiration for me, I'm following his work for years now. That Elon Musk would come into my city was just surreal. 
Sadly I was on vacation, I knew I wouldn't have the chance to see him. I thought: ""If I can't see him, my friends should."" so I told all my friends in Tübingen that Elon would come. They are also fans and were really excited too. 

In the beginning it wasn't even clear, if Elon would come directly to Tübingen but then CureVacs press officer confirmed it. 
Elon would arrive on Tuesday at a unknown time at the CureVac HQ but he didn't want press. It would be ""undercover“.
Knowing he would definitely come, we read news articles and searched through social media. We wanted to calculate the rough time when we could see him, arriving at CureVac. We had a battle plan! ↓
1. Wait in front of the CureVac building for Elon to arrive
2. Take a look at him when he goes into it.
3. Maybe ask him for photo. (A photo with Elon Musk is our biggest dream.) 

TUESDAY MORNING:
At 7 AM, 3 of my friends went to the CureVac building. Then they prepared them self to wait. 
With time more fans joined them. Some Teslas, driven by enthusiastic fans, parked on the parking lot. 
After a few hours CureVac had to order security to the building, because they were so many fans waiting. 
You have to know that the whole thing was a big event for us locals. Reporters were also waiting and there even was a live feed with the latest news. 

TUESDAY 4 PM: 
After 8 hours of waiting in heavy rainfall a Model X showed up at the end of the street. 
In it, on the passenger seat, was Elon. 
The car drove immediately in the underground car park, Elon didn't even greeted the fans. The local reporters shot some pictures.
Some fans (among them my friends) were dispirited and sad because they only saw Elon for a few seconds through the car window, they left. Others didn't give up and luckily stayed.


TUESDAY 8 PM:
After hours of meetings Elon came out of the building. He was surrounded by CureVac employees and bodyguards and had a black bandana wrapped around his face.  
He walked across the field in front of the CureVac building to bath in the crowd of the (around 50) fans, who waited. 
As far as I know everybody kept distance and he only exchanged a couple of words with a few people. Many fans made selfies from a distance. 
There was a engineering student, who had a sign with the words ""I WANT TO WORK FOR YOU!"". He showed Elon a self-built fully electric motorcycle. Elon was very interested and they talked a for a while. 

After 15 minutes of interaction with fans and reporters Elon left to drive to the airport.",1599070625,g3qyyk1,t3_ilc7bm,/r/elonmusk/comments/ilc7bm/elon_musk_visited_my_hometown_story_in_comments/g3qyyk1/,2,elonmusk,comment

Tübingen is a city in Baden Württemberg (Germany) and my hometown. It's not a huge but also not a small city. Tübingen is famous for it's university, many students and science. 

The vaccine manufacturer CureVac has its headquarters here. Tesla cooperates with CureVac and Elon visited them to see a new 3D printing technology, which could speed up the production of a Corona vaccination. 

MONDAY:

When I read that Elon would visit Tübingen, I was over the moon. Elon is my idol and an inspiration for me, I'm following his work for years now. That Elon Musk would come into my city was just surreal. 
Sadly I was on vacation, I knew I wouldn't have the chance to see him. I thought: ""If I can't see him, at least my friends should."" so I told all my friends in Tübingen that Elon would come. They are also fans and were really excited too. 

In the beginning it wasn't even clear, if Elon would come directly to Tübingen but then CureVacs press officer confirmed it. 
Elon would arrive on Tuesday at a unknown time at the CureVac HQ but he didn't want press. It would be ""undercover“.
Knowing he would definitely come, we read news articles and searched through social media. We wanted to calculate the rough time when we could see him, arriving at CureVac. We had a battle plan! ↓
1. Wait in front of the CureVac building for Elon to arrive
2. Take a look at him when he goes into it.
3. Maybe ask him for photo. (A photo with Elon Musk is our biggest dream.) 

TUESDAY:

At 7 AM, 3 of my friends went to the CureVac building. Then they prepared them self to wait. 
With time more fans joined them. Some Teslas, driven by enthusiastic fans, parked on the parking lot. 
After a few hours CureVac had to order security to the building, because they were so many fans waiting. 
You have to know that the whole thing was a big event for us locals. Reporters were also waiting and there even was a live feed with the latest news. 

TUESDAY 4 PM:

After 8 hours of waiting in heavy rainfall a Model X showed up at the end of the street. 
In it, on the passenger seat, was Elon. 
The car drove immediately in the underground car park, Elon didn't even greeted the fans. The local reporters shot some pictures.
Some fans (among them my friends) were dispirited and sad because they only saw Elon for a few seconds through the car window, they left. Others didn't give up and luckily stayed.

1870,Baida9,t2_ldaaa6n,"&gt; Everything he's ever done is a new product. 

No. Maybe, arguably, a few things he's ""done"" were actually new. But not everything. Neuralink for example is nothing new. The current state of art is way ahead of what Neuralink is hoping to achieve. They have been a lot of commentaries by neuroscientists recently on this.

&gt; Electric vehicles were pathetic.  

Implicitly, you admit that electric vehicles existed before. They were not good enough for your taste. Whatever you mean by pathetic. The best thing you can say is that Tesla is about to have success in offering attractive electric vehicles. Nothing new. Just better.

&gt;   Space flight was massively expensive and ruled by government agencies. 

Again you admit that he did not invent Space Flight. He just participated in making it cheaper and more efficient, as a businessman. Here I have to admit that his role is indeed innovatory. 

All of this is still not enough to make him the leading innovator in the world. SpaceX might be his only innovation.",1599086926,g3s3qnb,t1_g3rx7ip,/r/elonmusk/comments/ikzvpu/some_bullshit/g3s3qnb/,1,elonmusk,comment
